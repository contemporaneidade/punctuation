Taking into account the narratives of highly educated and professionalized middle class childless women living alone  I analyze general notions related to sociability in a broader sense  with especial emphasis to sexuality and friendship  and also to the meanings attributed to loneliness  bringing into question the social value conceded to the couple as the symbol of intimacy  At the light of some feminist ideas of freedom  equality  independency and autonomy  strengthened and expanded from the 1960s on in the  modern western societies  the analyzed notions send us to changes and permanencies  revealing a yet unexplored scenario of Brazilian big cities
