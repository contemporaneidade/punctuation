This article presents a panoramic view of the formation of the Brazilian religious field from the colonial times to the current days  It begins with a historic view of the Catholicism types that thrived in the colonial and imperial times in Brazil and of their characteristics influencing Brazilian religiosity to the present  It goes through the changes caused by the proclamation of the Republic  constitutional separation of the Catholic Church from the State and religious freedom guaranteed by the State  It follows the transformations occurring along the twentieth century with the establishment of a pluralist religious field in which Catholicism slowly loses its members to other religious groups  mainly the Pentecostal Protestants  without losing its hegemony  Nowadays  even though these trends persist  the dynamics of the religious field changes substantially as religious institutions lose their influence as a consequence of beliefs and practices becoming subjective  From this standpoint  the article analyzes the individual religious paths that are enabled by the increasing pluralism and progressive adhesion to religious duplicities multiplicities that add new ways of expression to the traditional ones  Such processes reach almost all of the religious mutants   except for the Protestants   including the Catholics who had gone after other religious experiences  and involve beliefs and practices from Eastern traditional and recent as well as esoteric sources
