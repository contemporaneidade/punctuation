In this article we seek to make visible the traces of a certain theory of culture present in the discourse of Freud  from the perspective created by the essay The Future of an Illusion  We register a curious parallel between Freud s discourse and that of John Lennon  some decades later  We also present Freud s ideas as parts of a  scientific project  and seek to make visible the multiple relationships established with culture  specially through the analysis of religious ideas  and the context which originated them  infantile helplessness  or human helplessness in general  We will further discuss the nature of this field that takes culture as an opportunity for analysis and interpretation  Cultural Hermeneutics  the notion of  libideme  as the libidinal counterpart of the ephocal episteme proposed by Foucault  and the horizon of transition from a culture oriented by repression to a culture oriented by perversion   all of this coinciding directly over life and art  producing apparently irresolvable questions
