This paper is an attempt to reflect upon Boaventura de Sousa Santos  ideas  especially the ones which shaped his work  A cr tica da raz o indolente  contra o desperd cio da experi ncia  having  as a theoretical support  Norbert Elias  sociological construct  In doing so  we mainly argue for the inclusion of two structural spaces  namely Espa o do Sujeito and Espa o Grupal  individual space and group space  respectively   in a social  map  devised by Santos  who named it as Mapa da Estrutura A o das sociedades capitalistas no espa o mundial  Structure Action Map of the capitalist societies in the world context  The need for the inclusion of these new  spaces  is justified by the argument that the individual  as we know him  was born together with modern times  Due to the possibilities of keeping a dialogue with himself as a subject  the individual can also be perceived as a structural space  controlled by both regulation and social emancipation forces developed by Santos  The social group  on the other hand  has its own dynamics  which cannot be totally apprehended neither by the domestic space nor by the community space  Having these considerations in mind  the author develops his contribution  from what he calls paradigmatic transition achieving three aims  first  he analyses and brings about the main features of Norbert Elias  work  second  he carries out a brief incursion into Elias  sociology  and finally  he proposes the inclusion of the subject and group spaces as relevant categories that will help to grasp the reality in movement  The conclusion does not only recall the first discussion  but it also points out the role of the two structural spaces proposed and the whole map organization as well  so that one can have a better understanding of the current processes and the construction of strategies  which lead to social transformation
