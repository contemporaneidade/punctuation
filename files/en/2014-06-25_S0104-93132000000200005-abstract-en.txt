This article draws on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in a boxing gym located in Chicago s black ghetto  It aims at explaining how prizefighters perceive and express the fact of being live commodities  and how they manage to reconcile themselves to ruthless exploitation in ways that enable them to maintain a sense of personal integrity and moral purpose  The boxer s experience of bodily exploitation is expressed in three related idioms  those of prostitution  slavery  and animal husbandry  All three tropes simultaneously enounce the immoral marketing of bodies  But this is neutralized by the belief in the normalcy of exploitation  in the  agency  of corporeal entrepreneurship  and in the possibility of individual exceptionalism  This belief  inscribed in the bodily dispositions of the fighter  helps to produce the collective misrecognition whereby boxers collude in their own commercialization
