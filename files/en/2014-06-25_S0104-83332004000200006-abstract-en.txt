The aim of this paper is to analyze part of Jorge Amado s novels that were published in the 1930 s in the context of the debates about race in which the author took part  Three books are the center of this analysis  namely Jubiab   1935  Mar Morto  1936  and Capit es de Areia  1937  It focuses on the possible articulations between the notions of race  class and gender in these books  from two different points of view  On one hand  it studies these books paying attention to what Jorge Amado himself considered a  proletarian novel    for this was one of his main concerns when writing his literature  On the other hand  it examines how the author used his  ethnographic data  about black people  since he elected them as the principal subjects of his fiction
