The main objective of this article is to analyze an ideal of civic life  the Republic  based on the form of the sovereign state  Historically  the convergence between Republic and sovereign state has been truncated by the former s commitment to the thesis of royal absolutism  However  as the democratic issue  translated in the values of equality and pluralism  was absorbed by sovereignism  such convergence became more plausible  As viewed in this article  the theoretical bridge of that passage is the concept of political representation  The issue is thus to show in what way a certain vision of the political form  that of the state  can fit into a theory of political representation that contemplates the above mentioned values
