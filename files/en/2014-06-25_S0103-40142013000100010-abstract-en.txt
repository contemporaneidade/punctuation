The wind power industry has experienced an exponential and virtuous growth in Brazil  From 2009 to 2012  in six auctions with participation of wind source  were hired 7 GW in new projects  representing over 25 billion dollars in investments  The trajectory of wind power is expected to reach in 2017  with 8 5 GW of installed capacity  which began with the Incentive Program for Alternative Sources of Electric Energy  Proinfa  Launched in 2004 and based on a structured model of funding and regional policies  Proinfa was responsible for hiring 1422 9 MW through subsidized prices  2012 was marked by the celebration of the insertion of 2 GW of installed capacity of wind power in the national electricity system  Therefore  Brazil closed 2012 with 2 5 GW of installed wind power  and 2  stake in the Brazilian energy matrix  But it was also a year of great challenges and difficulties for wind power  which culminated in a relative slowdown for this industry  Even doing just one auction  that had the lowest contracted demand of all  of new energy auctions that were already made  A limited engagement also resulted in very low prices  because the competition was very fierce  the offer was 28 times greater than demand  so the event was closed with the average prices of R  90 00 per MWh  The wind industry is passing through a crucial phase of consolidation  showing an immature stage  The existence of 11 manufacturers each have production capacity of 500 MW average per year of equipment  not necessarily determines a supply of 5 000 MW in machines  Admittedly the year 2012  for hiring  was a year under expected and it was not a very exciting period  because the economy grew less than the expected in 2013  But is expected the return to growth of national GDP  around 4  and resumption in hiring levels of electricity  enabling thus the maintenance of the sector target of 2 0 GW per year  ensuring the consolidation and sustainability of the industry in the long run
