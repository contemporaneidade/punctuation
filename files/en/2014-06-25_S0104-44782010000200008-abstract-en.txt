This article analyzes the critical move of certain feminists toward republicanism and explores the hypothesis that such a move represents important points of contact with a current of popular republicanism  Based on classical authors and adopting specific criteria for looking at the constitutive diversity of republicanism  we seek a way to define this current and as well as the aristocratic one which serves as its counterpoint  Our hypothesis is based  on the one hand  on analysis of feminist critiques of certain current formulations which  to a greater or lesser extent  share the republican ideal that contemporary society must endow public life with renewed meaning  On the other hand  it draws from particular proposals that have been elaborated in order to appropriate this ideal  Our analysis then makes it possible to suggest that the concerns that characterize the popular republican current offer more promising sources for combining the ideal of a renewed public sphere with demands for justice  Through this focus  we emphasize feminist contributions to democratic theory
