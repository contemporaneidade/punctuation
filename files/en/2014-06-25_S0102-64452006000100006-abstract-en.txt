The social function of property oscillates on a paradox that the juridical and political theories of the postwar period hide through the idea of the Rule of Law and the Welfare State  The social function of property illustrates that development of the communicative relations between Politics and Law  in which the first transfers its conflicts to the latter  turning political conflicts into legal ones  As it will be seen in this article  the result of that legal sublimation of the political conflicts is the symbolic generalization of the political expectations in the form of normative expectations  so that in those conditions they can be artificially tranquilized by the conditional programming of the Law
