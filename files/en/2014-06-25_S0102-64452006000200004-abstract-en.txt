The article issues on the relationship between political representation and democratic reform  presenting both analytic displacements from the approaches focused on the political system and the reshuffling of representation  and the omissions of the literature concerned on deepening democracy  Recent theoretical and practical innovations  which bring about much thinking on the future of representation  seem to assemble elements that supersede the limits of the liberal understanding and practice of political representation  Out of the critical rescue of the idea of  virtual representation  the authors suggest an agenda of democratic reform that could be able to account for those innovations
