This paper offers a succinct presentation of three different experiences of governmental decentralization  the cases of the states of Minas Gerais  Cear  and Santa Catarina  Analysis of these cases enabled us to observe two aspects that are fundamental for evaluating policies of governmental descentralization and regional development  the first is the problem of solutions of continuity  affecting public policy and representing a threat at every election time  The second is related to the qualification needs of governmental agents involved in the aforementioned policies  whose success is partially contingent on the former  In the state of Minas Gerais  decentralization processes were definitively interrupted  In the state of Cear  a modernizing continuism can be found  In the case of the state of Santa Catarina  the substitution of one initiative for another brought about a shift in inflections  but did not interrupt basic dynamics
