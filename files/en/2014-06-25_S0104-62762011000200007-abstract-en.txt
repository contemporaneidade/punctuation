In this article we present the results of a preliminary study about the effects of media variables on the voting decision process at the 2010 presidential election  The results from logistic multinomial models estimated with ESEB 2010 s data suggest that two of the five variable used here   debates and political awareness   influenced the voters  decision in favor of Serra and against Dilma respectively in the first and second rounds  At the same time two other variables presented counterintuitive results  a greater exposition to traditional press and to the program Brasil Urgente increased the probability on part of the electorate to defect or to cast blank and spoiled votes instead of voting on Dilma  Even though this is an initial analysis  the results are closer to the visions that defend a more active role for the media during the elections than with those visions that call for the media s irrelevance
