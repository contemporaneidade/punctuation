The aim of this article is to examine how the FNB  the Black Brazilian Front    the most notable Afro Brazilian organization of the first decades of the republican regime   was depicted in the Chicago Defender  the Black newspaper with wider circulation in the USA  The central concern is to show that the Chicago Defender produced a celebrative discourse about the Frente Negra Brasileira  inflating statistics and information  and engaging in laudatory exaggerations  In spite of its problematic and paradoxical character  such discourse is important because it reveals the interlocutions  interdependencies  and connections established by Blacks on both hemispheres and  at the same time  allows a reconfiguration of the role of Brazil in the Afro Atlantic circuit
