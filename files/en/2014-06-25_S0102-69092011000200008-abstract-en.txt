The paper discusses the contemporary crisis of the institutionalization of human rights  discourse  linked to the reproduction of global insecurities and to the limits of the connection between States  territory  and citizenship  It conveys the argument that the impossibility or incapacity of attaining human rights  in the context of a world divided by territorial states  resides precisely in the constitutive junction between the notions of humanity and citizenship  The dilemmas therefore produced are analyzed in light of the recent protests among resettled Palestinian refugees in Brazil and their disagreements over the international humanitarian regime  Thus  the paper advances the idea that the international human rights regime acts  within this critical perspective  as a reinforcement of the current political order  rather than as a means of subverting it  as some enthusiast of a human rights agenda as emancipatory politics would argue
