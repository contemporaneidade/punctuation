The article is divided into two sections  The first part presents data from a poll of Recife Law School students on the question of corporal punishment for graffitiers  prompted by the appearance of graffiti on the walls of the School building in 1994  On that occasion  21 5  of the students were shown to be in favor of corporal punishment  Repeated in the following years  the survey showed a steady decline in that figure as memories of the event faded away  The second part of the article reflects on the relationship between the proximity of violent events and the acceptance of measures incurring violations of human rights  and also ponders the resurgence of a type of punishment that seemed no longer to have any legitimacy in the modern polis
