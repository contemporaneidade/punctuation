The article examines Benedict Anderson s contribution to studies of the nation and nationalism in the social and human sciences  taking as its pretext the reissue in Portuguese of his most well known work  Imagined Communities  The text begins with a brief genealogical survey of studies of the nation and nationalism  which seeks to emphasize and question the relative disinterest that classical social theories devote to the idea of the nation and its specific forms of political  economic and sociocultural incorporation  Next it turns to the author s intellectual and civic career  contextualizing his interests and his analytic propositions  specifically in terms of the imagination of national identities and communities and their organization into nationalist movements  but also the notions of power and the virtualities and limits of the comparative method  and the role of ideas and cultural phenomena  Finally the text concludes with a critical and reflective exploration of the notions of imagination and community in Anderson s work  connecting their meanings  uses and appropriations with the historical  academic and political contexts of his intellectual career
