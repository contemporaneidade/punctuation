In their quest for the recognition of their customary territories  indigenous populations of the Americas have increasingly made use of modern techniques for the precise definition of territories  This has resulted in tensions between their often highly flexible territorial practices and the more fixed modalities of territoriality produced through such techniques  The objective of this article is to explore such tensions and their social consequences by analysing the territorial practices of the Uros  an indigenous group living on floating islands in the reed beds of the Andean Lake Titicaca  It will analyse such practices both at the community level and in their conflictive relations with neighbouring lakeshore communities and a protected area administered by the Peruvian state  The Uros  internal territorial practices reveal high levels of physical mobility and social flexibility  resulting from their continuous merging and scission of the artificial reed islands  However  their engagement with the state and its territorial practices has resulted in profound transformations to their arrangements with the lakeshore communities  In particular  it has resulted in a transformation of flexible  vaguely defined and shared territories into fixed  clearly defined and exclusive territories  Finally  I will analyse conflicts that emerged among the Uros when their leaders tried to apply mechanisms for territorial fixation in order to control the continuous merging and scission of floating islands
