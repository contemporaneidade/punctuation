Folklore is  chronologically speaking  the first theme taken up by Florestan Fernandes in his noteworthy intellectual journey  having dealt with this subject since his days as an undergraduate student at the Faculty of Philosophy in S o Paulo  If we consider his whole work  folklore is a secondary matter  specific to his student days  a  flat theme  from the beginning of his career  However  it is in these studies that Florestan wages his first academic battle  in which his adhesion to a scientific sociology takes shape  based on the systematics of observational procedures and scope of explanations  Thus  by looking at the small group of papers on folklore written during his formative years  1941 1953  it is possible to follow the first steps of his definition of sociology as science  which can be transcribed into three complementary lines of analysis  1  the sociological explanation for folkloric manifestations  2  the sociological explanation for folkloric studies in modern society  and 3  the redefinition of folklore as a sociological method
