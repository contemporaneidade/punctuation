Unlike recent interpretations of Marcuse s theory of technology  be it in praise or criticism  which identify in it a strong and continuing influence of Heidegger  I intend to show in this article  that Marcuse borrows important elements of Heidegger s phenomenology  and even more so  Husserl s  but also that these elements are appropriate within a general Marxist theoretical approach  Thus  the social and historical factors are emphasized as ultimates determinants of technology and technological rationality  Therefore  this paper seeks to clarify the relationship between Marxism and phenomenology in Marcuse s later work
