The objective of this work is to show that questions about ethics and integrity in research should be addressed from the discussion about the responsibility of the scientist and also of collective responsibility  This notion of collective responsibility implies a reflection on the values attributed to current scientific work as a whole in recent years  which has been directing the decisions of many researchers and organizations linked to the research and the results derived from it
