The current global power situation of the United States crystallizes a brutal unbalance of forces  Nevertheless  this immense power concentration neither means   nor guarantees   the permanent exercise of domination  This is also true because a nation maintains its hegemony as long as  while conducting the system of nations into a desired direction  it manages to be perceived as seeking general interest and favoring global governability  The idea of a new and more stable global order from Bretton Woods onwards was rapidly buried by the brutality of a market ruled by volatile capitals and submitted to high levels of instability  Despite the strength of the capitalist system  the affirmation about market supremacy created a wave of crises that swept through the last three decades of the previous century and continues until today  The fragmentation of global productive chains and the worldwide expansion of commerce ended up allowing for a greater participation of large peripheral countries in the world market  However  with few exceptions  the exchange terms continue in favor of the central countries and unbalance has increased  It is the function of these countries   especially the United States as the mean conductor of global policies   to face the urgency of a new global order  basically including efficient measures for the reduction of their agricultural and industrial protectionism  regulation of volatile financial flows and support for strategies that allow large peripheral countries to incorporate value into their local production  The latter  then  should not raise exaggerated hopes in relation to globalization  merely putting it forward as an important perspective and not as the center of their policies  Therefore  the concept of a national State needs to be reconstructed  which is capable of exercising its sovereignty in a mature way  simultaneously informed by a new notion of identity and by the circumstances of the global market
