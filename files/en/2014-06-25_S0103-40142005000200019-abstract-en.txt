THE INSTITUTIONS that offer graduate programs in Brazil are analyzed with respect to their diversity and quality  This diversity has grown in the last decades  Brazil had  in 2003  a total of 45 doctoral research institutions  73 that offered master degree  besides 1 554 institutions that offered graduate courses  The geographic distribution of these institutions is quite irregular  The relation between the number of institutions involved in graduate programs in Brazil and USA is similar to the proportion of the GNP of the two countries  The doctoral research institutions in Brazil  like in the USA  are basically public  followed by community type institutions that  in the case of Brazil  have often faith relate origin  Contrary to common believes  Brazil graduates a larger percentage of doctorates in applied areas then the USA  In fields like Agrarian Sciences and Health Sciences  the absolute numbers are similar  This implies a clear risk of future brain drain in these fields of knowledge  potentially damaging for countries like Brazil  The quality of the master and doctorate programs does not depend strongly on the administrative nature  if public  community related or private  The quality of the master programs of an institution depends on the number of its graduates but also on the fact that the institution offers or not doctoral programs  Distinct fields of knowledge seem to mature differently  Health Sciences present the worst Capes scores  4 2  while Exact and Earth Sciences present the best  5 7  Some institutions have reached international level in some of the large areas of knowledge
