Recent literature approaching the impacts of social and economic transformations on trade unionism in both Brazil and the world tends to emphasize structural determinants of the current crisis in union representativeness  However  comparative analysis suggests that variation in the unionization rate also depends on action strategies by union leadership and specific political or ideological situations in given countries  The article points out that an exclusive focus on structural determinants makes excessive concessions to globalization as an interpretative key  thereby denying space to politics  By way of demonstration  the article analyzes union membership rates in Brazil from 1988 to 1998 according to the economic sectors and individual characteristics of the adult wage earning population  It further demonstrates that the economic reforms now under way in Brazil explain the absolute variation in the number of union members  but not the relative variation  which suggests room for agency
