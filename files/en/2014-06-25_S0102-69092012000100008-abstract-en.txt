This paper explores three core analytical innovations  Lieberman  2002  Greif  2006  and Mahoney and Thelen  2010  produced by the second generation of historical new institutionalism about endogenous institutional change  It explores the logic of the key conceptual and analytical transformations in the recent methodological debate over issues on how to expand the explanatory powers of traditional models overcoming the exogeneity and stability bias problems  The main argument is that there is a substantial set of transformations coming through in the new institutional agenda via the introduction of new conceptualizations  theoretical frameworks and  fundamentally  through the consideration of a new set of causal mechanisms that allows new models to expand and deepen the analysis of institutional change mainly taking into account institutional causes
