This article analyzes the debate on public sociology  launched in 2004 by Michael Burawoy  former president of the American Sociological Association  Besides discussing Burawoy s main ideas and the criticism raised from his opponents  we specifically question the opposition between professional and public sociologies  In order to do so  we initially provide a reinterpretation of the history of sociology in the US  We claim that Burawoy s perspective on this history is what explains the dualism mentioned above  Then  we address the idea of public sociology from the perspective of the discipline in Brazil  Our main hypothesis is that a case study from a peripheral country may shed light on different forms of conceiving the public dimension in sociology thus contributing to broaden the theoretical debate on the subject
