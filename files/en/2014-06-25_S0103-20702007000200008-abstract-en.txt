This article examines Pierre Bourdieu s sociology of the market  assessing both the scope and limits of the thinking of one of the most emblematic authors of the New French Economic Sociology  Following a critical reading of some of his key texts  the article argues that Bourdieu s work involves a genuinely sociological analysis of economic phenomena  insofar as he applies his analytic framework   structured around the key concepts of field and habitus   to the economic sphere  showing that the market is the product of a social construction  As well as highlighting the social genesis of economic dispositions and describing the market as a field of struggles where agents with different resources confront each other  Bourdieu insists on the role of the State in regulating this market  In analyzing the economic sphere  he makes use simultaneously of a sociology of knowledge and a political sociology  However  although a pioneering analysis of economic beliefs  Bourdieu s approach presents a series of limitations  including a certain ambiguity in relation to the motivations of modern economic agents and the delimitation of the economic sphere
