For Habermas  a critical understanding of the democratic rule of law is not made merely with the denunciation of its many failures  It is about investigating them as blocks to its true potentialities  Thus  in Law and Democracy  the author tries to reconstruct the procedural conditions against which a process of radical democratization can move  putting the key elements of the democratic rule of law to a discursive model of critical theory  which turns to the use of a comunicative potentialities released in modernity  Starting from the lins of Law And Democracy to the critical theory of society  this paper aims to clarify the particular traits of the critical model there developed  as well as highlight some of its characteristic limitations
