This article aims to demonstrate how the Brazilian Superior Military Court of today  just as under the former military regime  continues to primarily defend what it considers the most important assets under its tutelage  hierarchy  discipline  and military duty  The Court has hybrid characteristics  displaying traits both from the authoritarian regime as well as from Brazil s current fledgling democracy  It is no coincidence that the Court has maintained its structure  functioning  and recruitment criteria virtually unaltered  The article contends that this institutional hybridism can only be overcome when effective democratic civilian oversight of the military is achieved
