This article analyses the presence of ethnography  especially the German ethnographic tradition  in part of the oeuvre by the historian S rgio Buarque de Holanda  In order to achieve this  we will focus on the book Caminhos e fronteiras  1957  a collection of essays written during the decade in which S rgio Buarque was the director of the Museu Paulista  1946 1956  This article is divided in two interconnected parts  namely  one about the author s experience when directing the Museu Paulista and how he got in contact with ethnology in that period  and one on how themes and concepts that were important in the German ethnological tradition also play a significant role in the book Caminhos e fronteiras  We intend to prove that ethnography was a central part of S rgio Buarque s analysis of the colonization of the outskirts of Portuguese America
