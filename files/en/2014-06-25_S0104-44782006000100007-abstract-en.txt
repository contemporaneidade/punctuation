Based on a study of his childhood village of B arn in southwestern France in the 1960s combining social history  statistics  and ethnography  the author shows how economic and social standing influence the rising rates of bachelorhood in a peasant society based on primogeniture through the mediation of the embodied consciousness that men acquire of this standing  The scene of a local ball on the margins of which bachelors gather serves to highlight and dissect the cultural clash between country and city and the resulting devaluation of the young men from the hamlet as urban categories of judgment penetrate the rural world  Because their upbringing and social position lead them to be sensitive to  tenue   appearance  clothing  bearing  conduct  as well as open to the ideals of the town  young women assimilate the cultural patterns issued from the city more quickly than the men  which condemns the latter to be gauged against yardsticks that make them worthless in the eyes of potential marriage partners  As the peasant internalizes in turn the devalued image that others form of him through the prism of urban categories  he comes to perceive his own body as an  em peasanted  body  burdened with the traces of the activities and attitudes associated with agricultural life  The wretched consciousness that he gains of his body leads him to break solidarity with it and to adopt an introverted attitude that amplifies the shyness and gaucheness produced by social elations marked by the extreme segregation of the sexes and the repression of the sharing of emotions
