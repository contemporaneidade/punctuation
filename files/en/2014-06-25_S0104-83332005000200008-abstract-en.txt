This article is based on ethnographic research conducted in an old zone of closed female prostitution in Rio de Janeiro   Vila Mimosa  I argue that the spaces created for the consumption of local sex are being used also for encounters between local sex laborers and foreigners  The discussion rises the question that this macrospace of female prostitution is becoming a stage for conflict when it becomes also a sex market used by foreigners
