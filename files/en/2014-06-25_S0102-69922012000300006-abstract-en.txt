Based on an analysis of manners books in four Western countries since 1890  this paper describes how  civilizing processes  have continued in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  The paper first focuses on three central functions of a  good society  and its code of manners  and then describes how  in a long term phase of formalizing manners and disciplining people   dangerous  emotions such as those related to physical  including sexual  violence came to be controlled in increasingly automatic ways  Thus  a second nature or conscience dominated type of personality became dominant  The twentieth century saw rising social constraints towards being unconstrained  and yet reflective  flexible  and alert  These pressures coincided with an informalization of manners and an emancipation of emotions  emotions that had been denied and repressed regained access to consciousness and wider acceptance in social codes  Yet it has been only since the  Expressive Revolution  of the 1960s that standards of self control have increasingly enabled people to admit  to themselves and others  to having  dangerous  emotions without provoking shame  particularly the shame fear of losing control and face  To the extent that it has become  natural  to perceive the pulls and pushes of both  first nature  and  second nature  as well as the dangers and chances  short term and long term  of any particular situation or relation  a  third nature  type of personality has been developing  Examples illustrating this trend also help us to understand it as a process of psychic integration triggered by continued social integration
