A number of scholars do not examine racial group identity among Afro Brazilians because of Brazil s history as a racially mixed nation  Given the growing strength of the black movements and the enactment of racial policies such as affirmative action that presume the existence of racial groups it is necessary to examine if racial group identity is salient  Using original survey data collected in 2006 in Salvador and S o Paulo  Brazil  there is evidence that an overwhelming majority of Afro Brazilians in identify as a racial group  Furthermore  there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between identifying as a racial group and voting for black politicians in Salvador but not in S o Paulo
