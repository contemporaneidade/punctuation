In the present article  I begin by inquiring about the relative inability of Brazilian evangelical Christians to utilize  culture as a weapon  While agents of other religions   and in particular Catholics and members of African Brazilian religions   have negotiated a certain subordination of the  religious  to the  cultural  as a strategy of increasing their ecognittion and social legitimacy by including themselves in the set of  cultures  which make up the nation  Evangelical Christians have ended to develop extenalist relationships with the cultural policies proposed by the state and by transnational secular agencies  Based on ethnographic data  the present article suggests that the hesitations and ambiguities of the Evangelicals with regards to these politics are related to a more basic engagement with the production of  partial universalisms  In other words  I argue that is a constituitive part of Evangelical Christian culture to maintain tense linkages of acceptance or rejection with those visions of the world that are conventionally accepted within this context
