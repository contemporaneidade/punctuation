This article  with its basis in theses and dissertations produced in the second half of the 1990 s  in the Post graduate Program in Sociology at the Federal University of Cear  analyzes the theoretico empirical trajectory of sociological and anthropological production that had the theme of the city as its object of investigation  The works analyzed express theoretical and methodological movements predominant in the social sciences  during this time in Brazil  They also demonstrate the growing interest in a micro sociological scale in approaches to the urban  as one of the effects of the influence of anthropology in the methodological and theoretical treatment of these objects  There emerges  from this set of works  an element of conflict in the practices of power  in relation to territories in cities  influenced by approaches coming from political geography  French sociology and history contribute with theoretical perspectives that prioritize the sense of creation and insubordination conferred on spaces as lived by distinct social actors  In this set of works  the neighborhood appears as a microcosm of social practices permeated by senses of belonging and conflict with place  as expressive of broader social struggles
