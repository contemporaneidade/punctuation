The goal of this essay is to critically examine the topic of work day reduction  expounding some of the important theoretical and empirical dimensions that are often excluded from public debate on the matter  Analyzing some of the characteristics of workers  contracts within the Brazilian labor market  we demonstrate that there is considerable distance between discourse and academic readings of the issue and its reality  The reduction of the work day is a multi faceted theme that characterizes a complex and polysemic debate  stirring the interest of a variety of social agents who are interested in the matter but whom maintain different conceptions of it  given the heterogeneity of the values that are at stake  We argue that the social implications of a political measure reducing the work day cannot be predicted  Nonetheless  such a reduction is a historic tendency  linked to socio economic development  There are marked differences between trade union discourse  political sympathies  theoretical assertions and empirical evidence on the matter This essay looks at two main dimensions of the topic  quality and quantity of employment  When examined from the quantitative side  the issue of job creation comes to the fore  in the interests of minimizing the effects of unemployment  When the focus turns to the qualitative side  what is at stake is the issue of the relationship of work activities to wealth and outputs  of providing real improvements in work conditions and worker s quality of life
