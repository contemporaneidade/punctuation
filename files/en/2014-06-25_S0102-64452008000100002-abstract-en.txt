This paper we will map the thought of Boaventura de Sousa Santos about participatory democracy  Before that  however  it will be important to analyse the structure of his social theory as a way to better interpret his proposed expansion of the democratic canon  For the Portuguese thinker  political participation has a key role in the rediscoverying of societal practices  It is through these practices that those individuals left behind could be included in the democratic process and therefore having the chance to work in the very definition of the community to which they are inserted  Democracy  in this view  is then a project of social inclusion and cultural innovation that arises as an attempt to institute a new democratic sovereignty
