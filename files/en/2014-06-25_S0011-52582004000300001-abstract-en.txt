This study reveals the longer term consequences of redundancy  shown to include discontinuous employment  deskilling and significant movement down the earnings distribution  Using evidence from the British Household Panel Survey  it is shown that craft and low skilled occupations experienced the major share of redundancies in the period 1991 95  Workers made redundant are less likely to work in future years and are more likely to experience significant downward movements in their occupational position and earnings  Work related training is received by a good proportion of ex redundant workers who regained employment during the period studied  but no evidence was found to support the hypothesis that the experience of training may protect them from the negative consequences of redundancy
