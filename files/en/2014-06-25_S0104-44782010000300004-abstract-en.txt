One of the problems that has attracted the greatest attention of scholars who study Regional International Organizations is the issue of representation  The institutional arrangements that have been built up within these organizations have sought to reflect representation in its twofold expression  in other words  as an assembly of member states and another that is made up of citizens  delegates  However  some arrangements have innovated by creating forums made up of sub national entities  thus seeking to attenuate what certain authors have referred to as the  democracy deficit  Our objectives here are to scrutinize the constitutive dynamics of two Southern Common Market organs of representation   i  the Mercosur Parliament  Parlasur  and  ii  the Constitutive Forum of Municipalities  Federate States  Provinces and Departments of the Southern Common Market  Foro Consultivo de Munic pios  Estados Federados  Prov ncias e Departamentos do Mercosul  FCCR  We attempt to identify the parameters that provide support for their respective compositions and  from there  go on to reflect on the issue of representation  We come to the conclusion that  notwithstanding the essentially consultative roles of Parlasur and the FCCR and their imperfections regarding practices of representation and control  they nonetheless become concrete elements that may or may not create momentum for new political inventions
