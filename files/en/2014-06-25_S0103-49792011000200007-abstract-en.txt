Taking as a guide the question about the possibility of understanding the existing set of injustices from the concept of recognition or the need to resort  for this  to the conceptual pair of redistribution and recognition  this paper aims to argue that the dispute between Honneth s monism and Fraser s dualism and refers to discrepancies in their social theories  From a reconstruction of the criticisms leveled by the authors to the social dualism of J rgen Habermas  as well as different social theories developed in order to resolve them  we will also seek to show that the answers they have found to these difficulties are in the center of debate about redistribution and recognition and that Fraser  developing a perspectival social dualism  adopts an intermediate position regarding those supported by Habermas and Honneth
