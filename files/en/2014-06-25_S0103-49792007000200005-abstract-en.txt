This paper tries to evaluate the consequences of the residential segregation  in other words  of the space concentration of certain social groups  for the conditions of access of the poorer population of the city of S o Paulo to the health policies  especially focusing on the conditions of access to the basic health service  Dialoguing with approaches that try to explain the differentiated conditions of access to public policies  this paper argues that several different variables demographic  institutional  spatial  relative to associativism  among other should be considered  to build a more complete scenario of the situations that condition the access to public policies  For such  the authors were based on a survey accomplished by the Center of Studies of the Metropolis  CEM CEBRAP  in November of 2004  that served as instrument for the evaluation of that policy
