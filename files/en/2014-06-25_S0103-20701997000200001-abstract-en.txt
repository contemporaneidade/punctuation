The point of departure of this article is a series of similarities between the  new history  associated with the French journal Annales  and the social history  psycho history or historical anthropology of Gilberto Freyre  similarities which range from a concern with material culture  food  clothes and housing  to an interest in mentalities and the history of childhood  a theme which preoccupied Freyre in the years before he published Casa grande   senzala  These similarities of approach were recognized by both Febvre and Braudel when they discovered Freyre s work in the later 1930s  Freyre was not imitating Annales  nor were Febvre and Braudel imitating him  He learned his interdisciplinary style at Columbia  a centre of the American  new history  movement of the beginning of the century  However  Freyre was  like Febvre  admirer of Michelet  His  historia intima  also owes something to the Histoire Intime practised by the Goncourt brothers  the importance of which in the history of historical writing has not been sufficiently recognized
