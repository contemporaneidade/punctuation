In the modern world  IDs are indispensable objects  without which we cannot prove that we are who we say we are  We need material substantiation that attests to the authenticity of our self identification  This paper is an account of an ethnographic experience about IDs and identification processes in the US  based on the examination of two events in which Eliot Spitzer  the New York State governor from January 2007 to March 2008  was a central figure  A comparison with the Brazilian scenario is present throughout the paper  and it ends by focusing on the ID theft phenomenon
