This article discusses the processes by which family structure affects students  cognitive performance in Brazilian schools  The article s basic premise is that family influence is not a uni dimensional construct  and the study thus uses four dimensions to capture such influence  The effects of these factors on students  performance are measured through a school attainment analysis model  The data are compatible with a model in which the parents  involvement acts as a mediating factor for the action of cultural resources  which in turn depend on economic resources  which have only indirect effects on students  cognitive performance in primary school
