The 1990s witnessed a dramatic decline in the international adoption of Brazilian children  from more than 2 000 a year in the earlier years to fewer than 400 by the end of the decade  Based on archival material  the current article outlines possible reasons for this decrease  considering hypotheses linked to the international market of adoptable children  legal restrictions on international adoption imposed by the Brazilian government  and scandals in the mass media that stigmatize local intermediaries and public officials involved in this activity  The study concludes that public opinion and scandals in the media have a heavy impact but are not necessarily the most adequate ingredients for a sensible adoption policy
