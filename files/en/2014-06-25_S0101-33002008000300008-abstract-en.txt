Brazil s literary scene was stirred in 2001 by the publication of the poem  S tio  by Claudia Roquette Pinto  who until then was considered an intimist poet  prone to metaphorization  and locked up in her own bourgeois world  This essay aims to discuss how the author could develop in that poem an understanding of fear and violence  without giving up her introspective imagery and her previous poetic experience  which is concentrated in a referentially scarce writing  The in detail text analysis intends to register the poet s conversion from the realm of opacity  lacunae  and indetermination to the characterizing of the urban violence and emotional misery that afflicts the privileged ones  Thus our analysis seeks to combine the implications of Brazil s present social historical reality with the vulnerability of the poetry and the needs of the poetic self
