CONTINUOUS GLOBAL advances in technology have apparently failed to ensure to future societies the ability to create flexible jobs exclusively through the use of market mechanisms  commanding income levels and being of such character that are compatible with the basic needs of the world population  The logic behind globalization and the segmentation of productive chains have  in part  absorbed pockets of cheap labor throughout the world without necessarily providing their workers with higher income levels  Formal employment is growing at a lower rate than direct investments  If  on the one hand  there are emerging and well compensated opportunities in the flexible labor market  on the other  the informal sector also spans precarious  insecure jobs and poverty  In the peripheral countries  particularly  governments   which are commited to stability   simplely do not have the funding and sufficiently effective structures to ensure the survival of the newly excluded  The employment paradigm is undergoing a definite shift  and there are myriad reasons for concern about the future of social exclusion in the new millenium
