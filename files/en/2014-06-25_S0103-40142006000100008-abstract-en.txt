AROUND 45 thousand people are victims of lethal crime in Brazil  yearly  Most of the victims are young  poor and black  from the shanty towns located at the large cities  Police are part of the problem  they have been  generally  uneffective  unilaterally reactive  corrupted and brutal  mostly because their organizational structures do not fit their needs to perform constitutional obligations  On the other hand  crime prevention policies are still restricted and fragmented  A dark future can be foreseen if a deep legal and institutional reform is not implemented  and the immediate causes of violence are not targeted
