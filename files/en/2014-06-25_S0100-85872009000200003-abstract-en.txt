The prayer is a ritual phenomenon of fundamental importance within the catholic religious system  An approach inspired by Mauss is used here in order to develop an ethnographic analysis of the ritual of prayer as practiced by catholics from the neighbourhood of Casa Amarela  Recife  Among other possible modalities  the ritual appears in several modes  simple  as a  minimal gesture  composite  for example  in the rosary ritual  and  finally  as part of a larger set  as occurs in the relations between the living and the dead where the prayer  in addition to dreams  functions as a communication channel between the living and the dead
