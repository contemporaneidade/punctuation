Like many other popular festivals known by their plastic and performative exuberance  the holy ghost festivals articulate a dimension that we may intuitively recognize as aesthetic but that can not be described and analysed as a differentiated and autonomous one  and the festival can not be recognized as a work of art in the strict sense of the term  The practices that compose it are inspired by moral  magical and religious categories  whose deep reason lies in the individual and collective obligation to please the holy ghost  Such technical  aesthetic  economic  physiological and psychological practices in the festival are implemented as a kind of counter gift to the holy ghost for the distinct forms of grace given to the human beings
