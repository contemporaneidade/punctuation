THIS PAPER is an excogitation on Brazilian immigration to Portugal and on the relationship between the immigrants and various Portuguese ethnic categories  Seeing that the sites chosen by Brazilian immigrants from among a hierarchy of Portuguese alterities presume an ethnization of the entire Brazilian migrant population  I have attempted to demonstrate that  hidden beneath the ethnicized label of  Brazilians in Portugal  one finds a diverse and extremely varied population in terms of how they build their identity  In addition  I have made a concise analysis of the political consequences of the ethnical political discourse regarding the citizenship and integration of the Brazilian immigrant population in Portugal
