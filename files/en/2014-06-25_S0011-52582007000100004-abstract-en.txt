The aim of this paper is to discuss the issue of space in the Brazilian social imagination  My working hypothesis is that the spatial images contained in some of the reflections by  interpreters of Brazil  like the Amazonian writings of Euclides da Cunha and the incipient comparative sociology of Vicente Lic nio Cardoso  are not related to an essentialist search for a fixed cultural identity  but to a vision of a national civilizing process that highlights the pragmatism and openness of this experience  I contend that the  land  as outlined by these figures  approaches Brazilian society to other national formations   Russia and America   thereby shaping a political sociology from the periphery
