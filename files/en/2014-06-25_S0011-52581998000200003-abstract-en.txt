The article discusses conceptual and methodological criteria applicable to the selection of social stratum classifications  With this in mind and based on the work of Erik Olin Wright and John Goldthorpe  the text presents the debate between neomarxists and neoweberians which has influenced studies of class and stratification  Defining a classification entails delimiting the theoretical conceptual context adopted in research and a suitable methodological treatment in order to determine  based on occupations  a social strata scheme which will allow us to study the structure of class positions  The theoretical approach adopted here lies within the class structural framework of social mobility analyses  while the chosen methodology involves application of conglomerate analyses and log linear models
