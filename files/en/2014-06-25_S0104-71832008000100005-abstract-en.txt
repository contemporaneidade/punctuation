Based on the work of the Brazilian plastic artist Diana Domingues we will present a reflexion on the imagination of the sacred in visual arts from the interpretation of themes  images  materials and formal categories which sustain contemporary language when dealing with the body in its relationship with the new communication technologies  The focus of the interpretation we offer will relate to the sense of sacred  or of that which is spiritual  in the interactive art of Diana Domingues  This sense refers to a state of widened communication and connectivity which is responsible for the expansion of the human conscience  by means of the body s experimenting the destabilization of fixed and complete worlds that is made possible by the new technologies  What is spiritual and sacred for this artistic movement is the non essentialness of life and of human beings or life as pure connectivity  It is exactly this that becomes apparent through Domingues  device works  Through them  this artist explores  in terms of ritual  performance and aesthetics  the interactive capacity of the new technologies in the creation of live environments and the visualization of life not as it is  but as what it can be like  What is sacred is this power gained from technology which  when activated by means of connectivity  makes human power itself to intervene in the real world and modify the environment appear  It is not the technology itself that is sacred  but the expansion of the universe parallel to the expansion of the conscience that is made possible by it  by means of widening connections between different systems  What is spiritual  then  is this constant state of transformation of conscience and human creativity to something beyond individual subjectivity  because the powers received by new technology are of an  ultra human  order  of an  impersonal  ultra subjective subject
