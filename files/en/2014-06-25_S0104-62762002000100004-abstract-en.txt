In this study  Singer s  1998  hypothesis that the ideological identity of the voters is a central factor in the voting decision for President is tested  The findings  based on the data analysis of four surveys carried out between 1989 and 1997  shows that there really is a mild intensity correlation between the positioning on a left to right scale and the vote for President  in the case of Brazilian voters  The correlation degree  however  just like meaning given to the terms  right  and  left  and the rates of positioning on the scale  varies significantly according to the schooling voters  and weak among those with low schooling The conclusion is that Singer s proposal for the inclusion of a ideological component seems adequate within a model which aims to account for the political behavior of a large number of the Brazilian voters  especially the ones with high schooling
