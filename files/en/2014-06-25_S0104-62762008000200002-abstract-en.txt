On the bases of ESEB 2002 and in LAPOP 2007  the article analyzes the evolution of the bases of the support of mass to the PT since Lula took office in 2002  Historically  only the PT has been able to build and maintain a fairly large base of partisan  identifiers  among Brazilian voters  But  since 2002  the PT became more moderate and far less concerned with ideology and with the principles the party laid out in its early years and the article investigates the impact of the moderation of the PT s leadership on the  petistas  The results suggest that it had few changes in the bases of  petismo  a slight moderation and a small change in socioeconomic profile  They also indicate that the sentiment about corruption remains unimportant as a determinant of  petismo
