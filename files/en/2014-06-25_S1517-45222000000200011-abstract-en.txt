This article approaches the gender problem as it appears in groups which stand for sexual equality and not discrimination  Since they are groups which have equality as one of their main goals  at first glance we could assume that the gender problem is not present among them  However  examining more closely the tensions and conflicts established in an organized homosexual group made up of both women and men  it is possible to demonstrate that  under those tensions and conflicts  there are different views of sexuality and action  established according to perceived attributes by the very actors involved as male or female  In the situation which was studied  the intensity of this problem was such that it resulted in the dissidence of some members and the formation of another group  A dichotomy was established between a group that claims for citizenship  seen as universal  and the other  dealing with issues that were seen as specific and  female  with a  re position of gender hierarchies by both groups
