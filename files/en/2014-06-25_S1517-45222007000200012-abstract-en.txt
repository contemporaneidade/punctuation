In this work  I attempt to identify the main characteristics of the new organizational forms of social movements based on the use of new information and communication technologies  After describing some cases  it is demonstrated that social collectives ascribe the internet a core role in their ways of interconnection  successfully developing new forms of organization  sharing ideas  aligning strategies  and building coalitions and alliance of global reach  Such phenomenon opens a new horizon for social change that points to the emergence of new dynamics for collective action based on complex identity networks  oriented by  universal values  It is on those trends that I focus the analysis in this paper
