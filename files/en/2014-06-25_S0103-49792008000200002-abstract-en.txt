Hegemony and empire are different words that offer widely distinct interpretations of the power of the United States and their contemporary manifestations  and how this power can be changed  After a brief introduction about both words  we will show how hegemony can be spatially understood and  in this way  how difficult it is for the hegemony of the United States to be channelled in an empire  pointing out the political military American fiasco in Iraq in spite of her apparent military supremacy after the Cold War  Finally  we will consider the emergency of a new configuration of global power where the hegemony no longer can be exclusively associated to the United States  The underlying central subject is the need to flee the trap of thinking power exclusively in territorial terms  States versus empires  The power grows spatially in much more complex ways and we needed to understand it if we want to question it
