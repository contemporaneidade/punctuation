This article discusses two conceptions of power  through the examination and critique of two research traditions  The sociological tradition  in which elitist current originates  postulates the existence of power within communities  the politological tradition  which generates the pluralist current  questions the existence of elites who direct communities and institutions  We argue that the postulates of the elite tradition must be proven  the pluralist current  on the other hand  is correct in inquiring into whether there are in fact ruling groups within society  yet the approach is restrictive and neglects an essential aspect of the issue  Thus  the authors argue that it is even more important for researchers   before going on to look at the visible face of power in the individuals and groups that make decisions  or impose vetoes    to pay attention to its invisible face  This other face refers to individual or group ability to control or manipulate social and political values  that is  to  mobilize biases  keeping topics that are a potential threat to their interests and perspectives from becoming the object of public discussion and deliberation
