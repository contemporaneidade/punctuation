This text proposes to accept the challenge posed by Cristina Pompa in her introductory text of the seminar  Religion and Public Space  held at the XXXV Meeting Anpocs 2011  The author urges us to rethink approaches and concepts that guide the current studies on contemporary religious phenomena  Firstly it is important to reiterate the terms that underlie the justification of the general proposition of that meeting which I fully share  Namely  the debate on the religious sphere in Brazil has been articulated  roughly around two readings  one of a more anthropological  and other more sociological that just don t communicate one to another  The first favored the cosmological interpretation of religious universes and the definition of  sacred  while the second dealt with the problem of secularization and modernization of contemporary societies  In order to combine the two perspectives into a new theoretical framework  I argue in this paper that  to overcome the normative bias implicit in the theories of secularization without falling into the sacred valuation of cosmologies  we propose to rethink the problem of relations between the religious sphere and public sphere form the perspective of the discursive practices of the actors  emphasizing how they interact in specific disputes  Thus  we will treat the notion of public sphere  not as an empirically observable entity  but as a space for dialogue that gains visibility  in part  through controversy and conformes itself in contrast to other spheres
