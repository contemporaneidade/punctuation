Triangulation has long been employed to provide validation for study findings that are easily critiqued because of small sample sizes or lack of generalizability  With a particular focus on using multiple quantitative data sources  we expand the use of triangulation within a sociological context  arguing that not only is sociology a field ripe for the use of combining different datasets  but that it is a useful tool when examining hard to reach and disadvantaged populations  Highlighting examples from multiple datasets that are typically employed to explore issues of Hispanic aging in the United States  we discuss how these different sources can be deployed to leverage findings  We conclude by discussing the application of triangulation to make sociological analyses policy accessible and relevant  a necessary pursuit  we argue  to ensure a sociological voice is part of the broader policy discussion
