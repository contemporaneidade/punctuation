Are government coalitions less frequent under presidentialism than under parliamentarism  The only difference be w e the two systems is that unscheduled elections are held under parliamentarism in those situations in which under presidentialism a majority legislative coalition opposes the executive  In both systems  portfolio coalitions are formed only when the formateur party and the one closest to it are relatively distant in policy terms  Otherwise  the formateur party governs alone  satisfied with the legislative outcomes  Hence  portfolio minority governments need not be less effective legislatively than coalition governments  Whatever is wrong with presidentialism  is not due to the difficulty of forming coalitions
