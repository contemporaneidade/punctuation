Kardecism is a religion which confers great deal of importance to the study of a specific literature  understood as the complement of a religious revelation  This article  based upon an ethnographic research in a traditional middle class kardecist center in Porto Alegre  examines some ways through which the kardecists  structured in small groups  relate with this literate tradition  The group is fundamental in the spiritualist identity formation for two reasons  it limits the way people belong and identities  converted into differences of doctrine comprehension  Besides  it is one of the instances of construction of the spiritualist presenter  who learns to profit from the reading of texts aiming to place himself as an orator  helped by formulas extracted from a specific repertoire  Inspired by the discussions on orality and literacy and in the recent proposal of an ethonography of reading  Boyarin  1993  I will try to show that  if the spiritualists  speech is built as orality supported by texts  there are also very important informal dimensions to be considered which contextualize and update these group s relation with sacred texts
