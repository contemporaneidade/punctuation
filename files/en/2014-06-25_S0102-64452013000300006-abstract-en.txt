The Inter American System of Human Rights today lives tensions and vulnerabilities that reflect the impact of the profound political changes experienced by the national states of the region in the late 20th century  The strengthening of the Inter American Commission and Court of Human Rights in recent decades has resulted in natural elevation of the rigor with which these bodies monitor and tighten the governments of countries linked to them  creating conflicting reactions  This dispute has a historic past and a dynamic that can not be ignored in the search for appropriate interpretation of recent events  with a view to finding solutions and ensuring new cycles of strengthening  Without this discussion  the system runs the risk of resurrecting the failed anteposition between rights of freedom and rights of equality  as if it were admissible to establish hierarchy between them
