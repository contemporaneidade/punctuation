A great part of the literature considers the managing councils  that have become thousands  in Brazil  as deliberative arenas which objective is to expand the citizens  direct participation in public decisions  However  the organizational model of the managing councils do not correspond to the traditional concept of participative democracy for two reasons  first  because the participants supposedly represent organizations  not individuals  and  second  because besides nongovernment associations  members chosen by state organs also participate in those councils  This paper explores the implications of those two characteristics of the councils to the democratization of public decisions  It argues that the councils should be understood as potential spaces in the which several actors not only they deliberate  but they also change their practices  Their contribution for democracy happens when the dynamic interaction among several actors produces new relationships and resources to direct concrete problems  what called  fertile relationships
