Studies about social inequality in Brazil usually focus on its objective dimensions  such as sex  colour  income  occupation  and schooling  The size of the gap between rich and poor is reasonably well known thanks to studies already carried out  but little is known about how the disparity is seen by Brazilians  In 2000  as part of the International Social Survey Programme  an attempt was made to fill this gap through a survey of members of the national elites   here understood as individuals in the richest 10  of the population  The nationwide study   2 000 interviews in 195 towns and cities   sought to reveal different perceptions of inequality by the  elite  and the  people  The survey raised issues related to the images both groups have of Brazilian society and how it is structured  the appropriate wages for differently qualified workers  the values that should govern distribution of the country s wealth  Brazil s major problems  and the strategies favoured by each group to reduce poverty  with an emphasis on the role of the State  The answers showed surprising agreements and disagreements between the people and the elite  Both groups recognise the scale of social inequality in the country  but they tend to advocate different strategies to reduce them  transferring solutions to inequality to the State  These similarities and differences in points of view may provide important elements for understanding the mechanisms that legitimise inequality
