This work seeks to supply elements for understanding the changes that can be verified within the country s poorest and least electorally competitive states  Our goal is to identify the factors that underlie a series of victories obtained by center Left coalitions during state election in 2002 and 2006  parallel to the weakening of old political bosses  Two hypotheses are elaborated in order to explain these transformations  First  we argue that  within the multi party federalism that has been built in Brazil  vertical competition between federal and state governments in terms of public policy supply acts to constrain clientelist strategies and state political bosses  electoral control  In the second place  the article argues that the Brazilian electoral system tends to promote political fragmentation and increase the costs for forming winning coalitions  while at the same time the absence of strong political parties makes it harder to stabilize inter elite competition and the patronage networks controlled by state governments    Empirical analysis is supported by analytical techniques of linear regression and simple linear correlation  in order to explore connections between national and state politics throughout the 1990s and the year 2000  Finally  we engage in a detailed analysis of the decline of the PFL  Partido da Frente Liberal   Liberal Front Party  political machine in Bahia  which was in control over state politics for decades  in conjunction with the Worker s Party  Partido dos Trabalhadores   PT  victory in the 2006 elections for governor  This part of the paper develops a model of linear regression in order to test the impact of local political dynamics and federal expenditures on fighting poverty  Bolsa Fam lia  on the PT s 2006 electoral performance  We end by concluding that Brazilian democratic institutions conspire against the survival of political bosses at the state level  pointing to the need to re evaluate established viewpoints on state politics
