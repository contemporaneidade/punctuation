References to the society of risk have become common and frequently tend to express more the spirit of uncertainty and insecurity of times than some properly defined sociological theory  The article briefly recalls the contribution of Beck and Luhmann  among others  to the sociology of risk and then moves towards the interpretation of risk as some aspect of the contingency of the modern society  Contingency awareness  though present in the occidental thinking since Aristotle  gained some accelerating impulse with Descartes  methodical doubting  before dramatically imposing itself with the implosion of the grand metaphysical systems  Making references to Tomas de Aquino and Richard Rorty  the article proposes reintegrating its essence to its accidental meaning  In rescuing the paradoxical structure of contingency it can then come to a better understanding of the standards of possibility for technical modernity
