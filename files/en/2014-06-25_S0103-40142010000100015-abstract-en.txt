Inventories of fauna directly access the diversity of a locality in a certain period of time  The primary data generated by these inventories comprise one of the most important steps in decisions making regarding the management of natural areas  However  several problems have been observed at different levels related to inventories of fauna in Brazil  and range from the training of humans to the lack of standardization of experimental design and selection of inappropriate methods  We present case studies of mammals  reptiles  amphibians and fishes  where they discussed issues such temporal variability and methods for detection of terrestrial fauna  suggesting that both inventories and monitoring programs should be extended for longer terms and that inventories should include different methodologies to ensure that their goals are fully achieved
