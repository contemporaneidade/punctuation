This paper aims at presenting an analytical reference that allows understanding pluriactivity as a strategy for social and economic reproduction for rural families  In the introduction  we present the context in which the study of family farming and pluriactivity emerges in Brazil  In the first section  we discuss the origin and evolution of the debate about pluriactivity  a situation mainly related to the reality in developed countries  In the second section  we try to position the analysis of pluriactivity in the context of the theoretical traditions that are classical in agrarian studies  showing how this phenomenon has already been object of concern for others authors  In the third section  we aim to position pluriactivity in the main contemporaneous analytical approaches of the social theory and indicate which one seems to be adequate for the study  In the fourth section  we discuss the central theme of this paper  which is the relationship between family farming and pluriactivity from a theoretical and conceptual point of view  In the fifth section  we indicate a methodological perspective to study pluriactivity in family units
