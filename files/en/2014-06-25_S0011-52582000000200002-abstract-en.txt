Asserting that the term  corporatist  is poorly suited and not very useful in describing the Brazilian case  the author employs an institutional approach to propose a typology that is polarized between legislated and contractualist models of labor relations  The argument is that the Brazilian model is characteristically  legislated  and grounded on the analysis of what is called the  three normative spaces of labor relations  that is  the law  collective contracts  and company norms defined unilaterally by the employer  Based on the  division of labor  of these normative spaces  the article shows  a  how the legislated model has reproduced itself and ratified the subordination of social legislation to labor law and  b  how labor laws subordinate and inspire collective contracts  and even informal labor contracts  while also limiting and informing managers  imaginations in the creation of labor norms defined unilaterally by companies
