This article deals with the relation between the academic disciplines of International Relations and International Law in a historical perspective  so that an accurate comprehension of the current interdisciplinary debate can be brought to the fore  Thus  conventional conceptions about the main theories of International Relations   realism and liberalism   are discussed  and those theories are presented in a new light  Liberalism is conceived in the context of the convergence of international politics scholars and international lawyers until the development of a skeptical view in the field of International Law  which is responsible for the creation of realism in International Relations  The post Cold War interdisciplinary debate is focused through three distinct theories  institutionalism  liberalism and constructivism  We argue that constructivism is more able to develop a deeper cooperation between international politics scholars and international lawyers  That is due to the connections between constructivism and critical theory  what allows joining constructivists and critical legal theorists in a Critical Agenda for International Relations and International Law in this beginning of the Twentieth First Century
