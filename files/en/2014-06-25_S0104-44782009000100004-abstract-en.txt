This purpose of this article is to explain why a two fold procedure of denaturalization and providing temporality offers the first step toward a new type of theorizing  We refer to the dissolution of notions of authority and identity of the State and the re definition of the problem of the international political order  as well as identifying alternative approaches that pursue the course offered by this two fold procedure within recent debates on political theory and theories of international relations  The central hypothesis whose correctness we intend to verify here is that this twofold procedure of denaturalization and providing temporality  time boundedness  allows the simultaneous destabilization of the internal segments that strengthen the State and differentiate it as a locus of authority counterposed to apolitical forces of domestic society and of the external divisions that distinguish it from similar international entities  Through this destabilization  Statist interpretations of authority are problematized and discussions on the international political order are re defined  creating new matrixes and renewing our understanding of the political  Alternative forms of organizing space can thereby be thought up  on the basis of appreciation of difference as a means for self reflection and social critique  and perspectives that consider the inconsistencies and ambivalence of State practices and that question State control over spaces and bodies  in favor of the preservation of their ontological and practical status  can be developed
