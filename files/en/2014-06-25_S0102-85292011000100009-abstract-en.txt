This paper examines practices of bearing witness and testimony that have arisen in response to the continuing migrant deaths in the southwestern deserts of the United States  I suggest that these practices can be considered a kind of resistance in that they restore the humanity to those who have perished and in doing so acknowledge that our contemporary bordered world harbors the spirits of those of have travelled he dangerous paths created by visible and invisible boundaries  The hope for more humane policies depends upon such an acknowledgement and keeping them alive in the public memory is key to promoting change  This paper also argues for a broad conceptualization of what it means to witness and provide testimony  The practices examined range from telling migrants  stories  to providing humanitarian aid  to practices of identifying the remains of migrants who have died and thus restoring their identity
