For more than two decades  Sudan has experienced a particularly violent conflict  opposing the northern Arab Muslim dictatorial government and the southern Christian and animist rebels  Often considered as an example of the  clash of civilisations  predicted by Samuel Huntington  1996  the sudanese conflict hides  however  a much more complex reality characterised by deep political and socioeconomic inequalities and asymmetries  For the biggest country in Africa  the promises of peace came with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 9 January  2005  Putting an end to an equally long and complex peace process  this Agreement is an ambitious one  including several protocols on power and wealth sharing and allowing  for the first time  for a possible secession of the south  through a referendum to be held at the end of a six year interim period  during which there will be a govern of national unity  But peace in Sudan is still uncertain  made difficult by the many obstacles to the implementation of the Agreement and challenged by a genocidal violence in Darfur and an increasing instability in the eastern regions  Through a more rigorous analysis of the complexities of war and peace in Sudan  this paper aims at evaluating the recent developments of the peace process and understanding the challenges posed to the prospects of a more peaceful and prosperous future in the country
