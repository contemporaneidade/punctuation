The article comments on the studies that analyze the Brazilian social formation according to the theoretical paradigm of personalism  emphasizing the debate with Roberto Da Matta s dual sociology  From a metatheoretical point of view  it criticizes the supposition  often implicit  of a unilateral and indifferent concept of Western modernity that makes possible the definition of Brazil as the  Other  within modernity  From a more properly defined theoretical point of view  it criticizes the lack of a theory concerning social stratification  which could promote an adequate comprehension of the interaction between values and their institutionalization  The second part of the article suggests an alternative interpretation from Da Matta s in which it considers some neglected aspects of his analyses that would allow us to perceive the relationship between backwardness and modernity as well as the coexistence between the real possibility of social ascendancy and marginalization  which has been a characteristic of Brazilian society  The alternative concept proposed to explain the dynamics of the Brazilian development is  selective modernity  which would possess  historically  a class dynamics departing from a differential appropriation of European influence and values
