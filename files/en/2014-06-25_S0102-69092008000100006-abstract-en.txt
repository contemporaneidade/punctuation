The article analyses the difference between the construction of scientific discourse and objects of science  For such  two studies are used as parameters for epistemological reflection  The first is the work of Latour and Woolgar  1997  which defends the thesis of the socially constructed nature of scientific facts  The second is the work of Delaporte  1999  that analyses the conditions which made the characterization of Chagas disease possible  The article uses the fundamental question of how to deal with unknown  or not yet scientifically constructed  objects and phenomena  such as certain types of organisms or  non human  beings  which place us in real situations  such as  life or death  to highlight the limits of the constructionist approach
