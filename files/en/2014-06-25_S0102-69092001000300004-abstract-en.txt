The text analyzes the relationship between religion and globalization  The author departs from the  universal  notion of religion  trying to understand how its meaning changes throughout history  With the globalization process  breaking the link between the Nation State and modernity  religion is redefined as a social phenomenon  Its scope  due to its  universal aspect  and its connection to the new technological means  surpasses national borders  allowing a performance in a planetary scale  In this context  universal religions should compete not only with other religious credos  but also with other worldwide proposals of conduct orientation  such as the universe of consumption  The relationship between religion and politics has also been modified  in the sense that universal religions are considered to be privileged institutions for which ethical actions in the world could be defined  Rethinking the past  the religions can define a new field of action  distinct from the restrictive relationship that existed previously to the advent of modernity and the confinement of religions to the private sphere
