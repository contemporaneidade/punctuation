The paper has two interrelated objectives  The first is to systematize and analyze the literature on analytical models for public policies implementation  We identified two main models  One is operated based on the evaluation of independent variables related to the organizational hierarchy  focusing on the formulation process  The other emphasizes variables related to the characteristics of local areas of implementation and the performance of the implementing bureaucracies  Both models emphasize the material conditions for the development of the implementation process  Starting from this observation  the second objective is to propose an analytical model for the process of implementation of public policies based on the integration between the central variables of those models and those linked to the ideas  the values and the worldviews of the actors  This is about discussing the analytical models for public policies implementation in the light of specific literature and empirical research conducted by the authors on health and education policies  We found that elements of the local action contexts such as representations and values of the actors influenced the implementation of public policies  shaping their understanding of the social problem and how to confront it  The discussion contributes to the integration of public policies implementation analytical models and to their operationalization
