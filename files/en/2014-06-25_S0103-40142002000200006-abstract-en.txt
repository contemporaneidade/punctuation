GLOBALLY  the terrestrial biota acts as a significant carbon sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide  CO2  The most recent estimate from IPCC for the 1990 s puts the terrestrial biota at a net sink of 1 4 gigaton of carbon per year  net carbon uptake by the biota minus emissions from land use changes  It is likely that most of this presumed sink takes place in mid latitude and tropical forests  Carbon cycle studies in the LBA Experiment indicate that the undisturbed forest of Amazonia may be a strong sink of carbon  at rates from 1 to 7 tons per hectare per year  whereas the wetlands may act as a source of carbon into the atmosphere of up to 1 2 ton per hectare per year  Deforestation and biomass burning in Brazilian Amazonia alone account for a net carbon dioxide emission of about 0 2 gigaton of carbon per year  Notwithstanding the still large uncertainties of these estimates  the balance of observational evidence points to the possibility that the tropical forests of South America function as a sink of carbon from the atmosphere
