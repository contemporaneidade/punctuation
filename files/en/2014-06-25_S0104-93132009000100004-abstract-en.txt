This paper develops a novel approach to anthropology and history of international borders  It proposes a typology and a phenomenological characterization of two kinds of border crossings that emerged alongside the new relationship of economic and political dependency that developed between M xico and the United States in the last quarter of the 19th century  The new border crossings involved the development of new  chronotopes  in other words new and competing spatial temporal matrices  used to frame the relationship between M xico and the United States  This paper analyzes the quality  nature and stakes of these alternative forms of historicity by way of a close case study of two pivotal journalistic texts  James Creelman s  1908  interview of General Porf rio Diaz  and John Kenneth Turner s  1910  reportage and expos  of Mexican slavery
