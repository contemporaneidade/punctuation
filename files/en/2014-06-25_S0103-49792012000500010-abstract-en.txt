The use of sanctions is a commonplace and it is usually associated with an expectation to increase the strength of a rule s normative force  Some experiments confirm this intuition and indicate that punishments make people cooperate more  Philosophers  however  debate without consensus on what should be the purpose of punishment  Despite the normative discussion  psychological studies show that ordinary people tend to make retributivist judgments  Moreover  psychology has pointed out some asymmetries in punitive behavior  such as the difference in people s standpoints when projecting norms and when they must apply the same norms  the influence of moral judgments in assigning intentionality in punitive judgments  and the perplexities involving punishment of accidents  The philosopher of law should aim at achieving an integrative view of the different information concerning punishment both to describe law more adequately and to construct a viable normative theory of law
