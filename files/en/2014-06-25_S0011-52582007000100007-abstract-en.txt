The aim of this article is to verify the analytical feasibility of Two Level Game   TLG theory to analyze Brazil s action in the World Trade Organization   WTO  We simultaneously analyze whether the enhancement of Brazilian democratic institutions in relation to foreign policy making can help meet demands by interest groups and expand the technical quality of Brazilian diplomacy in international trade negotiations  We further verify whether this improvement can generate greater credibility and international legitimacy for Brazil s actions in the WTO  allowing the country to shape favorable international regimes for its interests  We develop this argument by analyzing Brazil s drug patent case against the USA in the WTO
