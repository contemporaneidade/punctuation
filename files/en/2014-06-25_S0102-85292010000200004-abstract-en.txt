The aim of this paper is to analyze the links between Mexico s democratization and its human rights foreign policy under the Fox administration  exploring the impact of the democratic transition on the adoption of a new foreign policy platform in which human rights became a central theme in Mexico s foreign affairs  We argue that the observed changes in the Mexican human rights foreign policy were initiated endogenously in the government  which expected to lock in Mexico s new democratic situation with international commitments and to assure international audiences of the credibility of its commitments to democratic reforms and human rights
