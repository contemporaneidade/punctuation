The trajectory of syndicalism in Brazil from 1978 to 1998 appears to be a passage  at the level of syndicalist strategy  from confrontation to conflictive cooperation  or still  from class struggle in production towards a  antagonistic convergence  or a participative syndicalism  which is  nothing more  nothing less  than a defense of a newer type  of neo corporative aspect  What it is aimed to characterize here is the progressive prevalence  in the hegemonic syndicate practice of CUT in the 1990 s  of this workers  neo corporatism  which tends to debilitate the class perspective that characterized political and syndicate struggle in Brazil in the 1980 s
