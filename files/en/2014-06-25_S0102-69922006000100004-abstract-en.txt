The rapid expansion of the globalisation processes in recent decades has given rise to the emergence of forms of resistance to their consequences  as well as to processes of social mobilisation in favour of an alternative globalisation  The article that we are presenting includes part of the results of research into the movement for global justice in Spain  In it we deal with the material base of this movement  the characteristics of its activists  their political identity  their motivations and interests  the identity attributed to the action of the movement  as well as the political cartography sketched out by the evaluations of the alter globalisation activists  Our aim is to analytically dissect the coordinates that frame this new form of subjectivity  whose social space is articulated around three axes  the spatial axis  inside outside  inclusion exclusion  centre periphery  the relational axis  above below  imposition opposition  repression liberation  and the axis of praxis  diversity of social practices carried out by the participating agents
