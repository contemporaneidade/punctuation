Thomas Hobbes has become a canonical figure for theories of international security even though his writings say relatively little about what we would now call an international system  This paper suggests that Hobbes remains important for the analysis of international security  as well as for political theory more generally  not because he advances any coherent theory of international relations but because his account of the sovereignty of particular states requires an account of the external conditions of possibility of such states  Politics after Hobbes needs to get to grips with the constitutive effects of his particular philosophy of history  Thus  this paper proposes a political reading of Hobbes that emphasizes his importance for thought about modern politics and its conditions of possibility  about its origins and limits that are also our origins and limits as modern subjects
