In his final years Goethe was obsessed by the so called  spiral tendency  The problem  however  was far from new to him as the versions and variations of curved lines and spirals in Goethe s work clearly show  These forms can actually be found at the crossroads of poetry  visual aesthetics  namely of ornaments  and scientific studies  A crucial point of reference for aesthetics in the later 18th century was William Hogarth s famous concept and model of the  line of beauty   1753  which also left its traces in Goethe s writings  even in his late period  This study examines his elegy  Amyntas   1799  the essay  Fossile Bull   1822  and texts on the metamorphoses of plants and the spiral tendency in vegetation  Spiral forms seem to be so fascinating for Goethe because  with their manifold functions and meanings  they allow us to cross the borders between different genres and disciplines and to connect different kinds of thinking  This transgressive intellectual activity  which we could call  transdisciplinary  remains a model for important thinkers of the 20th century  such as Paul Val ry  Walter Benjamin or Aby Warburg
