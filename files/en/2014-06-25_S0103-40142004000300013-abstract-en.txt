THE BIOGRAPHY of two Brazilian psychics   Spiritist channelers Chico Xavier and Luiz Antonio Gasparetto   is this essay s object of thought  a review of the relationships created by Spiritism in the Brazilian religious milieu  stressing in particular the dialogue with the country s hegemonic religion  Catholicism  and  more recently  with the universe of the so called New Age  In the life history of the two mediums  Catholicism plays a central role  for Chico Xavier as a matrix to reinterpret the Spiritist doctrine  for Luiz Antonio Gasparetto  as an object of criticism  The two biographies  therefore  characterize distinct moments in the history of Spiritism in Brazil  At the same time  the simultaneous existence of both models evinces competing modes of their contemporary expression in Brazil
