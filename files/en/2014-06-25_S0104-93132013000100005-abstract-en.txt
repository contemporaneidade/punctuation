The paper reexamines distinct approaches to the constitution of sociality in indigenous Amazonian contexts that differ with respect to the heuristic value attributed to  trust  and  intimacy  in the light of Huni Kuin  Cashinahua  ethnography of the body  personhood  trust and thought  For Huni Kuin people thinking and trusting are embodied processes that are constitutive of sociality among living persons  Grounded in a critical appreciation of the uses of the analytical frameworks emerging from discussions of  Amazonian perspectivism  and  fractality  for revealing the indigenous ontologies at work  the paper argues that it is necessary to go beyond an ontological emphasis and also take into consideration its interface with indigenous epistemology and phenomenology  It argues that Huni Kuin perspectivist understanding of the engagement of virtual sociality and lived sociality in a multinatural universe depends upon this interface
