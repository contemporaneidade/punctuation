The article proposes an analysis of the rural space based on its opposition   relationship with the urban space  In this sense  from the mid nineteenth century until almost the last third of the twentieth century  the classical sociological analysis established a conceptual and analytical dichotomy between these two worlds  but at a certain moment the restrictive meaning of this dual vision was reformulated with the introduction of a more complex conception with a highly relational aspect  There are currently three perspectives on the rural model that emphasize different structural changes  which are not necessarily exclusive and alternative  On the contrary  the realities of the rural world are increasingly open to new ideas that do not necessarily fit the general trends that affect the urban areas
