This paper interprets the formation decades of the Paulista sociology  1940 70  in the light of the main disputes among institutions  groups  and agents occurred in this context  which was unified by the attempt of explaining the recalcitrant Brazilian modernization  Following this direction  the specific sociologies  which had been gradually constituted  were primarily analysis perspectives and not specializations themselves  The exposition takes alternative pairs as references  which involved oppositions such as  essay vs  science  radical thinking vs  conservative thinking  empirical theory vs  empirical research  totalizing interpretation vs  dualist interpretation  Sociology of Development vs  Sociology of Culture  The tensions that make up the period are delimitated from those oppositions  which should not be rigidly understood
