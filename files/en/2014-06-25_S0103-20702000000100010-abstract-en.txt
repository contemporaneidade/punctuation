This paper analyses the new meanings of violence in Brazil  It argues that they emerge due to changes in the nature of Brazilian society  These are included in the context of more widespread transformations that associate processes of globalization and fragmentation  The text also discusses new angles of analysis that lead to thinking about violence through a relationship between exclusion inclusion seen  not as excluding and dichotomic forms but as categories which belong to the same dynamic process  in which social actors can alternatively experiment forms of inclusion exclusion originating from fragmented  differentiated  plural social processes
