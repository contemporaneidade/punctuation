This essay demonstrates that Niccol  Machiavelli s political thought addresses the deficiencies of two opposite poles of contemporary democratic theory  As do formal or minimalist approaches  he specifies electoral mechanisms for elite control  and similar to substantive or civic culture approaches  he encourages more direct and robust modes of popular participation  On these grounds  I cull from Machiavelli s Discourses a theory of democracy in which the populace selects the elites who will hold office but also constantly patrols them through extra electoral institutions and practices  such as the tribunes of the people  public accusations  and popular appeals  Machiavelli adds to these institutional features of popular government an important cultural dimension  The people should despise and mistrust elites  and they should actively confront the injustice that elite governing inevitably entails  Finally  I explore the ramifications of this theory for debates over elite accountability in contemporary democratic theory
