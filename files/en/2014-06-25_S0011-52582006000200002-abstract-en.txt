This article seeks to identify the determinants of the existence and powers of upper legislative chambers  By analyzing their constitutionally established powers  including all of the minimally democratic bicameral countries  it was possible to reach conclusions not previously suggested in the literature  Using a two step model whose calculation includes the possibility of a selection bias  Heckman model  the study evaluated both the factors leading to the existence of an upper chamber and those defining its powers  Federalism proved to be an important variable for explaining the difference between bicameral and unicameral countries  but not for explaining the political strength of upper chambers  The most relevant explanatory variable in this sense was the system of government  in Parliamentary systems  upper chambers have limited powers  in Presidential systems they exercise broad powers
