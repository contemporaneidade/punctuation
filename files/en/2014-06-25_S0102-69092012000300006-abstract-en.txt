The purpose of this paper is to investigate the internal dynamics of decision making in the Supreme Court  STF  focusing on the answers that the Court gives to the demands brought to it via direct control of constitutionality and the factors that influence these responses  Our hypothesis is that depending on the profile of the justices sitting in the Court the answer given will be different  The argument is that changes in the composition of the Court are reflected in changes in the decision making pattern  To test this hypothesis  we have chosen a period of great renewal in the composition of the Court  between the second Cardoso government  1999 2002  and the first Lula government  2003 2006  We have mapped out the patterns of decisions in cases Direct Actions of Unconstitutionality during that period and the factors that influenced these decisions  The conclusion of this research is that the composition of court and the justices profile matter  but the most determinant variable to the outcome of the decision is the vote of the rapporteur  The data analyzed also allows to state that that unlike most studies indicate  the Supreme Court is not too parsimonious in its action
