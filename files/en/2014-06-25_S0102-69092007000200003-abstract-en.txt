This article deals with writings about art  particularly the sort of  artists  lives  and their role in the formation of the artistic environment in Lisbon and in Rio de Janeiro  As in their origin  in the Italian sixteenth century  the  artists  lives  have been articulated to the establishment of Academies  and they had an important role in the artists elevation as a social group  which was possible with the concomitant elevation of the drawing arts to the condition of liberal arts  This change of state always depended on a double discursive articulation  For one side  that one which in the biographic perspective individualizes the artist and  by the praise  confers him the nobility of the merit  for the other side  that one which inscribes him in the tradition of the city or  later  in national traditions  giving to his art a historical perspective that mixes his achievements with the achievements of the city in arms  letters  sciences  and other virtues
