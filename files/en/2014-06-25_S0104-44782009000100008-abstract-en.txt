The Brazilian democratic transition  still underway today  has run up against enormous difficulty in incorporating penal action  Or  put in yet stronger terms  we could say that the boundaries of democratization processes  delineated through the action of that sector of the State  reveal the possibility that the juridical field remains immune to democratizing change  Although prevailing discourse among law professionals asserts that Penal Justice is undergoing democratization  what we have observed in practice is a strong resistance within the juridical field to assuming political responsibilities within the consolidation of democracy  This article reports analyses and conclusions formulated through observation of the Brazilian penal justice system that gave origin to the thesis entitled  Penal Justice in Brazil today  democratic discourse  authoritarian practice  The research sought to reflect on contemporary criminal justice policy  which has been guided by the widening of repression and the continued use of incarceration  Such policy  carried out in Brazil since the beginning of the 1985  political opening  has adjusted itself to the liberal project that is also currently underway in the country  as well as in almost the entire Western capitalist world  As we can observe  Penal Justice  even during the execution of sentences  operates in authoritarian and exclusive ways  suppressing the rights guaranteed by law to those who have been sentenced and adopting extremely repressive forms as demonstrated by the extremely sparse benefits that it concedes  Thus  in Brazil  criminality has generally been responded through severe sentences  reflected in the absence of guarantees of constitutional rights and ample recourse to incarceration  In this vein  our contemporary democratic governments have frequently adopted a punitive stance that seeks to reaffirm the State s aptitudes for punishing and controlling criminality
