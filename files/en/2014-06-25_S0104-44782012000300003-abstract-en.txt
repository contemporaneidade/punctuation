This article seeks to examine the positions that Brazil defended during the Lula administration  2003 2010  on nuclear non proliferation  disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy  My central argument points to the way in which Brazil consolidated aspirations present at an earlier date and how it attempted to position itself as an interlocutor mediating states that had and did not have nuclear arms  The idea was to reinforce the country s position in conflict resolution  in terms of greater participation in international forums and  in particular  increasing its activities in developing rules and norms to limit the unilateral action of major powers and maintain flexibility in articulating the interests of emerging nations  Brazil sought to pressure states that had nuclear arms to comply with their disarmament obligations  while seeking to preserve its own autonomy in developing peaceful nuclear uses  In the first section of the article  I examine the development of the Brazilian nuclear program and the State s position in relation to international regimes in the field of nuclear non proliferation and disarmament  In the following sections  I look at the position of the Lula administration regarding non proliferation and at peaceful uses of nuclear energy and  lastly  at nuclear disarmament  Among my conclusions I give particular attention to the fact that  at the same time that Brazil enabled dialogue with Northern powers and guaranteed regional stability and security  the country also acted as a catalyst of states  demands within institutions  as they sought to widen opportunities to make themselves heard
