Modernity was a central theme in Costa Pinto s work  with two distinct interpretations  The first and more obvious of these implied a rejection of the term  inasmuch as it conceptualized a kind of historical and social evolution which he rejected as a model or telos for Brazil  It was characterized by the adoption of consumer  behavioral  and institutional patterns  as well as values and ideals taken from more advanced societies  without necessarily entailing real changes in the existing economic and social structure  There was  however  another way of conceptualizing modernity  which Pinto  in a much more positive vein  calls  development  This would embrace and improve the welfare of the whole population  bringing about a transformation to a new  social structure  Whereas  modernization  was by nature unplannable  development implied the opposite  as it had the State at its very core  It is argued that this notion of development  albeit outdated  is still to some extent valid  though a change in the concept s overview of modernization is required  instead of regarding the state as the great agent of modernization  we need to see it as one of several collective subjectivities that are to push forward the development process
