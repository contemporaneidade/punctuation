The early 21st century is witness to the rise to power of new leftist and center left governments in South America which have at least two common traits  the questioning of pro market policies and reforms which were carried out over the preceding decade and the return of the State as a central actor in economic life  In spite of this convergence  a deeper analysis would allow us to perceive a certain heterogeneity in the programmatic and organizational character of the new progressive governments  In this regard  we propose an analysis of the responses to the crisis of neo liberalism that the Brazilian and Argentine governments have provided  placing special emphasis on economic development policies and their implications for regional integration  This more systematic analysis enables us to see that Argentina and Brazil have made different choices regarding what type of policies they have adopted  Brazil has resorted to more orthodox practices such as restrictive monetary policies meant to contain inflation  while Argentina has preferred more heterodox methods such as price controls and export restriction  as well as other policies that encourage consumption  To a certain degree  the differences between the choices made can be attributed to the very economic and political trajectory of each country  pro market reforms were more intense in Argentina than in Brazil  which meant  regarding productive structure  greater de industrialization and the extinction of several developmentalist institutions
