This article examines the political thought of Roberto Campos between the decades of 1950 and 1970  In this period  in addition to holding important governmental positions  Campos also devoted himself to struggles around ideas  publishing a large number of articles and essays  Our hypothesis is that his political thought points to the institutionalization of a political system that is authoritarian in nature as the most adequate for the cultural and political conditions of Brazilian society  The main characteristic of this type of system is the hypertrophy   in relation to other republican powers   of State executive power under military and technocratic command  The main function of the hypertrophied executive is the collaboration with and implementation of institutional reforms and  rational  economic policies  against the supposedly particularist and irrational resistence of different sectors of Brazilian society  This view collides head on with Campos acute  suggestion that the regime that was instituted after 1964 represents a sort of updating  under prevailing societal conditions  of the ancient Roman republic institution of the  comissary dictatorship  in which the election of a dictator for a short period of time in order to contain possible threats to republic institutions was permitted
