This paper aims at enabling a theoretical conceptual discussion about the concepts of decent labor and worthy labor  from the conceptual contraposition between citizenship and human rights  Its argument is that decent labor would refer to the basic idea of citizenship and to an operational concept  clearly pointed out in the order of the day of the International Labor Organization  ILO  whereas worthy labor would refer to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  UDHR  depending on a network of rights  In order to transpose this dichotomy  we propose a complete overview of human beings at work  based on the concept of recognition and the holistic approach of human rights  which form the basic idea of decent labor
