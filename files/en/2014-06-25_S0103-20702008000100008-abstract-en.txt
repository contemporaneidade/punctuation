The article examines the process through which education from the 1970s onwards became a key variable for explaining the inequality in Brazilian incomes and a public policy tool for economists  Among other factors  this resulted from   1  the struggle of professional educators between the 1930s and 1950s to produce a policy oriented body of knowledge concerning education  and  2  the success of economists during the 1960s in imposing their own interpretative models of Brazilian life  displacing the educators  In both periods  governments and transnational agencies facilitated an international circulation of people and ideas  manipulated as a resource by those involved in this competition
