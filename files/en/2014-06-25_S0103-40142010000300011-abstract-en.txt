It appears that successive governments under Lula s presidency followed two opposite economic philosophies  The first one  the monetarist philosophy  aims to curb increases in prices  very high real interest rates  important primary budget surpluses  appreciation of the national currency  This explains the difficulties in raising investment rates  in raising the added value of products and in promoting the development of production of high technology content products  The secon one  Keynesian  aims to reduce inequalities  to raise minimum real wages and to ensure wider social security cover  It explains high growth rates and domestic market renewed dynamics  Because of the international crisis  this second philosophy influences economic policies more heavily than in the past  and offers an opportunity to enter a new era  providing however that the obstacle of a regressive tax system is removed and providing the implementation for the future of a new  more active  industrial policy lowering the risks of primarisation currently threatening Brazil
