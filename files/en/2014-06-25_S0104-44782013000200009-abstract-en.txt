This essay is based on the recent literature about representation on public polices management councils  There are several analyzes by various authors on the subject  however  it s necessary to think about the confluence of these ideas  in order to contribute to a minimum consensus  obviously not definitive  about the possibilities and limits of democratic exercise in management councils  need that this article aims to answer  at least in part  To develop this analysis  we review the literature in order to seek authors from different areas of knowledge that somehow deal in their works the theme of democratic theory and participation and representation  trying to observe convergences and counterpoints in their ideas to after launch issues minimally consensus on the subject  The authors analyzed make it clear that the discourses that permeate the issues of participation and representation have as background different democratic theories that almost throughout the last century conflict for hegemony  representative democracy and participatory democracy  Thus  the ideal that underpin the concepts studied here are expressed in different ways  according to the theory that underlies it  The fact is that participation and representation can be exercised both in a representative democracy and in a participatory democracy  However  have different meanings and practices  The public polices management councils are a kind of instance created to the exercise of participatory democracy  However  there is exerted indirect participation through representation  This concept  in turn  is strongly rooted to the ideals of representative democracy  making necessary to establish differences between represent  representative democracy  and represent  participatory democracy  so that counselors representatives of civil society in management councils not repeat the mistakes of the practice parliamentary representative  at the risk of driving the representation in these participatory instances to a distance that would undermine the exercise of participatory democracy in our country  It seems obvious the importance of establishing a relationship between representatives and represented that approach them  Thus  important points such as accountability and own way of choosing the representative for their entity appear to play a role interesting to legitimize the representation and make it different from parliamentary representation  Despite obstacles to the realization of a true participatory democracy  the management councils feed a changing political culture in Brazil  the culture of participation  that can replace our historical submission culture of the people to the power of the elites
