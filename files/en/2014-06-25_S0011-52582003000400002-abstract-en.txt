Shugart and Carey posit that presidential democracies in which legislators have a parochial focus of representation are electorally inefficient because voters are not offered highly identifiable choices on national policies  Such systems are driven by an inefficient secret  which is essentially a nonpartisan representation of the policy process  To check the propositions of the inefficient secret model  ISM  this article investigates the aggregation level  effect  and subject of Brazilian deputies  legislative input and output  Our empirical analysis indicates that  although some ISM related factors drive legislative output  there is partisanship in deputies  legislative input  This result means that the ISM underestimates the prospects for programmatic parties  especially in the opposition  to emerge within systems where the electoral and constitutional rules encourage particularism
