Recent steep declines in trust in government among the mass publics of institutionalized democracies have rekindled interest in legitimacy theory and research  Theorists have long conceived of political legitimacy as multidimensional  and argue that it ranges from abstract support for a political community underlying regime principles to the more concrete evaluation of regime performance  institutions  and actors  However  surprisingly little empirical research has evaluated the theory s construct validity  Employing a national sample survey from Costa Rican  a stable and successful democracy  we explore whether political legitimacy empirically exists and examine its structure  Using confirmatory factor analysis  we find evidence supporting the multidimensional structure of political support  We also identify certain limitations with both the theoretical and limited empirical research  related to misleading operationalization and the specification of empirical links that we fail to detect  We also find and remedy a surprising error of omission   that prior research overlooked local government as a target of legitimacy beliefs
