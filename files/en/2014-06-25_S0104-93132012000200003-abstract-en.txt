Debates about the internationalization of the social sciences have focused on globalization  This article  however  analyses the field of European social science as a case of transnational regionalization  The growth of European funding provoked increasing collaboration across national borders  In these emerging transnational regional structures  three patterns stand out  The first concerns the predominant position of the larger countries  in particular  Great Britain  The second concerns variation across disciplines  certain social sciences display a much higher level of international orientation than others  A third pattern concerns the significance of European collaboration in a more global context  European collaboration has increased  but its broader significance seems paradoxical  while European journals and associations have a rather peripheral position as compared to those based in the US  European social scientists are more cited than their U S  American brethren
