This paper surveys the recent literature on modernity and postmodernity  and relates it with the neoliberal ideology that for thirty years was dominant in the world  In relation to modernity  it claims that major sociologists who analyzed neoliberal modernity failed to acknowledge that it was a reactionary and  consequently  a transitory form of modernity  In relation to postmodernity  it criticizes its excessive relativism and pessimism  as well as its rejection of the great narratives and of the possibility of progress  The paper acknowledges that society turned to be increasingly complex  but emphasizes that this problem is coped with an equally complex social coordination system in which informal and formal regulation are intertwined
