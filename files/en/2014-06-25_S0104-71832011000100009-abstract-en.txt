In this article  I explore the limits of magic bullet approaches to global health problems and show how people centered initiatives challenge economic and human rights orthodoxies and enlarge our sense of what is socially possible and desirable  I draw from my long term ethnographic study of the Brazilian therapeutic response to HIV AIDS and its repercussions through government  markets  health systems and personal lives  I also report on a new comparative project on the aftermath of large scale pharmaceutical interventions in resource poor settings  Attending to both larger processes and to human singularities  the article opens a critical window into the values and the real life outcomes of contemporary pharmaceutical and humanitarian interventions  As I critique institutional evidence making practices I also reconsider anthropology and medicine s notions of responsibility and care
