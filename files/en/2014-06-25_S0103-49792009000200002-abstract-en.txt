This article was the basis of an address to the Japanese Sociological Society  Tohoku University  We revisit the main points of the public sociology  It is made taking into account the capitalist system international crisis  I do believe as sociologists  despite national traditions and global inequalities  we do share a common interest  and even mission  to combat the market fundamentalism that has spread throughout the world   a project that is now showing signs of fissure and exhaustion  Despite the measures against crisis put forward by governments sociologists have their own interest in channeling the counter movements toward a stronger and more democratic civil society and a more robust and inclusive public sphere
