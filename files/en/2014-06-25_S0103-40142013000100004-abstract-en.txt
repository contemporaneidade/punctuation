Research on working memory has been focused on fractionating specialized subsystems responsible for storage of verbal  visuospatial and multimodal information  In the present paper  we review the fractionation of visuospatial working memory into separate visual and spatial components  The availability of visual codes in working memory is supported by the effects of visual similarity and irrelevant information  Spatial memory seems to depend on attention resources and its relationship with visual memory is still controversial
