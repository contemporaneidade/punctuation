This article aims to raise new issues in the understanding of Pentecostal expansion by focusing on the interactions between charismatic leaders and ordinary believers  more specifically on the practices and meanings resulting from these interactions  We will investigate how the Pentecostal leaders are elevated to a position of spiritual superiority over the ordinary believers in a religion where such a hierarchy of difference is challenged  The concept of charisma  shared within these interaction  is central to our goal  We will then establish a relationship between the sharing of charisma and pentecostal expansion  since the success of Pentecostalism depends on the ability of the leader has to make charisma circulate  These factors will be verified in a comparison between the performances of the pastors Silas Malafaia and Valdemiro Santiago  the major evangelical celebrities of the day  This work is based on fieldwork carried out both in the churches and in events captained by those leaders
