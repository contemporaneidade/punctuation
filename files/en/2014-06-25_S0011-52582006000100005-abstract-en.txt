This article has two main objectives  1  to compare how two of the most influential contemporary thinkers  Richard Rorty and J rgen Habermas  relate to the legacy of American philosophical pragmatism and 2  to use this case to illustrate a meta theoretical proposal of mine  The Rorty Habermas comparison will allow me to present what I refer to as  dialogical pluralism  that is  a theoretical and methodological perspective which  inspired by the American pragmatism of Dewey and Mead  refuses to adopt the separation between theory and history of theory  On the contrary  the dialogical pluralism that I propose conceives social sciences  past as a repository of forgotten treasures that must be urgently reconstructed in order to better solve the problems of our time
