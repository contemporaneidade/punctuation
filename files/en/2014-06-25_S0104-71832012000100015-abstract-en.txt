This paper aims to explore the articulation between genetic ancestry research and social constructions of ethnic identity in the state of Rio Grande do Sul  It will do so by analysing the social life of a research project conducted at the UFRGS that established genetic continuity between the contemporary Ga cho population and the assumedly extinct indigenous Charrua  In the course of time  this idea of genetic continuity has taken on different incarnations  within varying contexts  and affirmed with differing levels of certainty  This paper will focus on the social and genetic conditions that have enabled the establishment of such continuity  as well as the affirmation of the genetic distinctiveness of the Ga chos  Finally  it will explore the social impacts of this research  in particular its articulation with constructions of a differentiated regional identity
