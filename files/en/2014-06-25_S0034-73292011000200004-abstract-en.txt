Our aim in this article was to compare the discourse of the two presidents that governed Brazil in the last 16 years  Fernando Henrique and Lula  We used the method known as content analysis to investigate more than a thousand addresses delivered by both presidents in diplomatic events in Brazil and abroad  We found important similarities and differences in the subject matters and in the alliances they managed to make in the international arena  Both presidents privileged the issues related to the economy  to international institutions and to the relationship with South America  Fernando Henrique seemed to have given more attention to issues related to democracy and to have been closer to European countries  Lula extended his concern to inequality issues to the international context and dedicated to establishing a more open dialogue with Asia  the Middle East and  most of all  with Africa
