The aim of this paper is to provide theoretical and empirical elements that allow us to reflect on the political culture as a condition for the exercise of active citizenship in a metropolitan context marked by a historical dynamics of segregation  Therefore  we sought to highlight the importance of taking into account the dimension of urban inequalities in order to understand the distinct political cultures hold by metropolitan citizens  For this purpose  we used data collected in a survey on political culture applied in 2006 in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro  Also  aiming to illustrate the impact of socio spatial differentiation on the political behavior of metropolitan citizens  we used spatialized information from the results elections for state legislature  in 2006  in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro  The data analysis indicate a significant internal differentiation according to the indicators of political culture used  and that this distinction largely corresponds to the socio spatial differentiation of the metropolis  So  first  we confirmed the importance of taking into account the urban dimension in the analysis of political culture in metropolitan areas  and  secondly  the analysis of election results indicated possible connections between the political culture dimension  understood in its socio spatial differentiation  and the dynamics of political representation
