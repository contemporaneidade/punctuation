This paper examines how survey questions about democracy are framed in different ways  depending upon whether an idealist or realist definition is employed  and whether or not comparisons are made with alternative regimes  It starts by reporting measures of democracy in post Communist countries that ask people whether they are satisfied with democracy and to compare it with an ideal standard  Subsequent sections set out the results of realist questions from the New Democracies Barometer  which ask people to evaluate regimes past  present and future and historically familiar undemocratic regimes that people have known
