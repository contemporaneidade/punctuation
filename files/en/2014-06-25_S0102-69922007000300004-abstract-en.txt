The article is based on two qualitative research projects held in Rio s favelas  The empirical material is drawn from one of its activities   conducting and recording approximately 50 hours of a process that has been denominated as  trust collectives  This expression intends to stress the way participants of 15 focal groups  involving 150 residents of more than 40 favelas  were recruited   acquaintance and trust built through previous relationships with at least one of the researchers  This criterion was planned as a way of minimizing the expected effects of the  law of silence  imposed by agents of violence in these localities  The text analyzes enunciations collected during these debates  which were clearly concentrated on the different ways in which criminal gangs and police forces make their presence and behavior felt within Rio de Janeiro acute s favelas  The authors sustain that  less than questioning criminal and police violence as a whole  favela residents are intensely worried about some of its manifestations which prevent them from carrying out their daily activities  Without being directly taken up as a theme for dialogue  this is the horizon that calls out their attention and that organizes all their critical comments to  people outside  as well as their attitudes and behavior towards their fellow favela inhabitants  The authors go further by arguing that  in their descriptions and denouncements  residents do not homogenize the agents they consider responsible for destabilizing their routines  On the one hand  there are institutional police practices  the famous  operations    recurrent raids on favelas in order to fight drug dealers  and the arbitrariness of agents  regular behavior  both of which are felt to be almost completely unpredictable  On the other hand  when dealing with the violent practices of drug dealers  with whom residents are obliged to share their territory  there were many accounts of attempts  successful or not  of reducing the unpredictable quality in the flow of daily life  This occurs by adjusting behavior to a calculation   unworkable and or ineffective in the case of police action   of the risks involved in such a situation of forcibly sharing the same space  This calculation  making a small part of local violence easier to  administrate  permits re absorbing it as an  extraordinary  part of  ordinary  routines
