Every theory has its own biography  Hannah Arendt s work on totalitarianism was born from her experiences as a German Jew  exiled from her own country  Central to her nonconformist thought is the notion of pariah  inspiring a political philosophy in which she seeks to reconcile intellectual freedom with political commitment  Behind this philosophy lies a humanist anthropology whose nucleus is a conception of shared human experience  the diversity of which resides precisely in an original creative freedom  As a result  her work challenges exclusive identities and borders   products of the modern nation state   and in place proposes a civic culture and a form of justice transcending national limits
