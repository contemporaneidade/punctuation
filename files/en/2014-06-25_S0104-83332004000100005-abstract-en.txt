The most evident distinctions that can be seen in the fashion market are those related to gender differences  independently from the social class or group  In such universe  the notions of elegance and attitude can be found  and they condense simultaneously gender  social and individual marks  In the case of the notion of elegance  the discourse  as well as the clothes or the individual him herself  always refers to a certain conception of the social order conceived as natural  Gender differences are relevant in this context because they indicate social positions understood as natural ones  Otherwise  the notion of attitude does not necessarily demand a social and natural order  but an individual one  Discourse and clothes reveal an individualistic aspect  assuming that it is the individual who produces meaning in his her social insertion  even if only temporarily  In this context  most of the time  individualism is expressed in a genderless language
