This article is an initial elaboration of the screen persona of the American actor Humphrey Bogart at the film The Maltese Falcon of 1941  I argue that the notion of the Hollywoodian person produces the mediation between the image of the artist and his her social trajectory  It is a kind of symbolic power  capable of establishing the artist within the structure of cinematographic production  In this manner  I use a scene from the The Maltese Falcon to relate the two analytical axes of this argument  on the one hand  the sign of gender that characterizes Bogart s persona  alternating between apparent indifference and sudden vulnerability  on the other  the visual culture   unthinkable as separated from a local social experience   a symbolic dimension that constrains the geometry of the eyes  audience  camera  cast  My narrative searches through a series of clues collected from various sources  films  literature  biographies  historiography  sharing with the Hollywoodian classic its most characteristic trait  the detective mode of knowledge
