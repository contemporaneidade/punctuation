The aim of the present article is to discuss some aspects of the ambiguities of the indigenous legislation from the colony period to the second half of the century XIX in Brazil  Ultimately  those ambiguities revealed the established tensions between the local powers and the Portuguese metropolis since the laws sent by the Portuguese crown in favor of the freedom of the Indians were not executed in practice  persisting the indigenous captivity until his formal abolition in 1831  However  even after the abolition  the legal defense of the indigenous rights would be a constant theme of intellectuals and politicians during the second half of the century XIX  since the absence of that defense disabled the integration of the Indians to the State nation
