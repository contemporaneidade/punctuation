The article discusses the issue of autonomy and preferences considering different approaches in feminist political theory  The respect for individual beliefs and preferences has been considered a main feature for democracy within liberal tradition  But even in this tradition there are distinct understandings of how those preferences are defined  how they are connected to individual structural positions and the opportunities that those positions open or constrain  Feminist analysis considers constraints  but also evocations and interpellations  constituting preferences and identities in contexts of social inequalities  The work focuses on the tensions between the value of individual autonomy  taken as an epistemological and a political framework  and the critical understanding of oppression and domination as the basis for socially produced identities
