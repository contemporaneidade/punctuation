This paper analyses the perceptions of men and women on the compatibility between paid jobs and family  from the standpoint of gender relations  Based upon the results of a survey carried out in Brazil in 2004  it is examined whether there is a rapport between more equalitarian perceptions regarding gender and more shared attitudes regarding household work  There is also an attempt to identify the weight and the extent to which various factors  e g  cultural  socioeconomic  and demographic  are relevant to the existence of values and routine practices that entail the perception of more balanced and symmetrical marital relations
