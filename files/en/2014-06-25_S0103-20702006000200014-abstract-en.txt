In this article  I trace a scenario that is becoming increasingly actual and close to Brazilians  In that scenario racial inequalities coexist with a popular state regime in which Black NGOs participate in the implementation of multicultural policies and racial democracy ceases to be a hegemonic discourse  We have acquired consciousness of the limitations of our democracy  of the multicultural nature of our national formation  and of our invidious system of racial inequalities  but we are not successful in stopping it from reproducing itself  I take this scenario as an occasion to point to two current misinterpretations in the sociological literature  neither are racial inequalities in Brazil the product of racial democracy  neither can racial inequalities result from the mere existence of racial categories
