An ethnography of the legal services provided in S o Paulo s Citizenship Integration Centers allowed me to analyze the informal and formal rituals of conflict resolution practiced by the S o Paulo State Police  the Public Prosecutor s Office and the Judiciary in the context of a service integration program  The analysis afforded a political sociology of the state management of conflicts  which emerged as a fragmented and plural field in which logics of conflict resolution and agencies dispute the meaning of extending rights and justice to Brazil s low income population  The plurality of logics aimed at conflict resolution allow  on one hand  a freedom of choice for the public involved in defense of their interests  on the other hand  it reproduces inequalities between public users and legal agents  undermining the effectiveness of state law  Rituals from the legal field also contribute to hierarchizing circumscribed bodies and vulnerable bodies
