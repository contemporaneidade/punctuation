This article investigates the performance of the Brazilian Senate in light of the current bicameral structure  Since the Senate is almost always a reviewing body  and since amendments are an objective indicator of its role in revision  the article analyzes the variables which influence senators to amend the projects which are reviewed  It is assumed that the senators are not merely  rubber stamping  projects  nor are they recalcitrant about using their veto powers  The general hypothesis is that the senators  choices depend on variables such as the bicameral configuration of representation  the position of the House in the decision making process  and the origin of the legislation  Along general lines  it was noted that bicameralism in Brazil minimizes the chances of conflict in the Senate  however  it was noted that certain variations in the composition of coalitions and in the degree of bicameral divergence of party forces accentuate senators  willingness to amend the projects that come before the House
