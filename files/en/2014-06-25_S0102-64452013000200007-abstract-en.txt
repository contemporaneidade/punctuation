The article is an analysis of the experience of Indian democracy dating back to attempts to render it more democratic  For this effort  it divides the question in three thematic levels  the armed struggle  the presence of Maoist guerrillas in Central India  the primacy of civic sphere of politics and the dominance political sphere over the legal one  All of them will reveal themselves incapables to radicalize the Indian democracy  The main question highlighted in this article lies in the fact that the three attempts end up proposing  in different ways  the negation of politics and  ultimately  democracy itself  which was harshly conquered in India by its independence revolution of 1947  At the same time  draws attention to two fundamental aspects  On one hand  the widespread distrust of citizens in the state s ability to equate and forward solutions for the serious economic  political  social  ethical problems affecting most of the population of India  has real basis  On the other hand  only the resumption of democratic politics restores the missing links of the national revolution
