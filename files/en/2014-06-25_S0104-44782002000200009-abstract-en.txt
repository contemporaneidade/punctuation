Based on regional socio economic indicators and consolidated results from 1994 and 1998 elections for governor in the state of Paran  this article presents data that demonstrate high levels of voting  volatility  that would not be perceived through data analysis at the aggregate state level  I analyze the electoral results from the gubernatorial dispute in Paran  through geographic divisions  using municipalities as my unit of analysis  Votes that candidates received in the diverse municipalities of the state are organized according to size of the latter and according to their levels of socio economic development  as measured through the IDH M  1991 Municipal Index of Human Development  Municipalities are classified as micro  small  medium and large  In order to establish a parameter of socio economic development  I use the IDH  classifying municipalities into the following groupings  very low IDH  low IDH  medium IDH and high IDH  My aim is the social and geographic identification of the electorate that supported the major candidates for governor of Paran  for the above mentioned consecutive elections  I show that there was an important level of electoral volatility in both of the elections which Jaime Lerner won  an aspect that is not perceived when analysis is based on aggregate election results  The deeper issue at stake here is related to the discussion of voting behavior in mass democracies  in which the voter is identified as a subject of the electoral process who has constantly changing demands and desires
