This article aims to map and investigate the methodological debate spearheaded by the Cambridge School of history of political thought in the last four decades  focusing on the formulations of Quentin Skinner and the main objections raised by his critics  After a brief presentation of the prescriptions in Skinner s methods  the article discusses how his linguistic contextualism has been criticized for  a  his epistemological commitments  denounced alternately as relativist and positivist  b  his adherence to intentionalism  and c  his tendency towards  antiquarianism  The article concludes that of these three modalities of objections  the attribution of  antiquarianism  was the one that most compromised Skinner s original methodological formulations  recently leading him to virtually abandon his original antipresentist thrust
