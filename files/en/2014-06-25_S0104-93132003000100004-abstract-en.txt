The article analyses  acculturation  a concept deriving from cultural anthropology  from a social anthropological perspective  The term  ex Cocama  was coined by cultural anthropologists to denote the supposed loss or refusal of an indigenous identity by the Cocama people of Peruvian Amazonia  These people therefore seem to represent a classic case of  acculturation  The article argues  however  that this apparently classical example of acculturation is better understood as yet another example of an indigenous Amazonian sociologic  for it is made out of classical themes of sameness and difference  potential affinity and onomastic processes as other indigenous Amazonian societies  This continuity of structure within radical transformation therefore raises questions about the nature of Amazonian history  questions that have simply been obscured by the very concept of acculturation
