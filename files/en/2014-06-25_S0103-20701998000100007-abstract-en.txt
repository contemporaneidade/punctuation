This article contains some reflections on how social violence expresses itself  These reflections  presented in former moments as lectures  public debates and at a congress  have been gathered under the title of Urban Violence because they all try to comprehend everyday violence as a problem of urban society  Based on the lectures I have formulated the first part of this article  which deals with a conception taken from social anthropology  the characterization of violence in rural society under the perspective of structural marginality  in order to explain the genesis of this problem in the actual social class society  The debates  that took place because of traumatic happenings related to the police apparatus  have brought about a discussion of the causes of violence inherent to the performance of the institutional functions  of military and civil police  The last part of this article is the result of my taking part in a congress organized in order to debate the new Brazilian Traffic Code  It takes into account the role and  particularly  the meaning of the social symbols divulged by the mass media as aspects responsible for the increment of traffic violence
