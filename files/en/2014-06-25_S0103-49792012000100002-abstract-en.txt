In general  the role of historical investigation within ethnological studies is quite secondary and limited  Alternately  I intend to bring both disciplines together in order to show the diversity of indigenous peoples  characteristics throughout the history of the State of Amazonas  The ethnic uniqueness should be approached  I suggest  not as a reifying specificity but as something essentially variable and dynamic  as a result of a fundamental process of adaptation to different kinds of social and natural environments  In my ethnographic research study on the Ticunas  they are usually mentioned in reference to concrete and distinctive historical situations in which their beliefs  traditions and organizational principles emerge in connection with Brazilian broader society s determinations and projects
