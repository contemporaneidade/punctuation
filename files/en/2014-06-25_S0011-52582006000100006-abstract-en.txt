The central scope of this article is to prove  in theoretical and empirical terms  that industry is still at the center of the socioeconomic changes experienced by Greater Metropolitan S o Paulo  GMSP  and the surrounding territory in recent years  We will thus highlight evidence that the industrial sectors of GMSP provide the basis for the trends toward territorial reorganization of production in the State of S o Paulo  Our objective is to demonstrate that notions of a purported post industrial metropolis and the shift of industrial development to the interior of the State seriously hinder an adequate understanding of the role potentially played by Metropolitan industrial chains in positive development agendas
