This article studies members of the major public policy management councils in the municipality of Curitiba  Councils of Health  Social Welfare  Labor and Council on Children and Youth  state of Paran  We observe that the groups studied have   in relation to the Brazilian population in general  a larger amount of political culture resources and therefore  more incentives for political activism  We then go on to discuss two theoretical questions related to  political culture  First  we look at the problem of the causal relationship between these institutions and the political culture of their members  In this regard  we recognize the importance of institutional effects on the political culture of individuals and at the same time  the active role that factors that are external to the institutions analyzed here have on the intensity of such effects  In the second place  following an alternative route to the one that is usually taken in the literature of the field  we look at political culture as a resource that is unequally distributed among the groups that make up the institutions studied here and that can therefore be considered one of the bases of political inequality
