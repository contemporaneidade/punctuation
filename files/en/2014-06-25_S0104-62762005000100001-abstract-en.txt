The rise of the radical right is open to multiple interpretations  The question addressed in this paper is whether many of these parties have fostered an enduring social base among core voters and  if so  which social sectors are most likely to support them  The first part discusses the alternative theoretical frameworks provided by the classic accounts of the 1950s and 1960s  the  new social cleavage  thesis common during the last decade  and the theory of partisan dealignment  Then  it compares evidence to analyze rival hypotheses about the social basis of the radical right vote across fifteen nations  using data drawn from the European Social Survey  2002  and the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems  1996 2001  The second part focuses upon the role of socioeconomic indicators  while the third part considers the enduring gender gap and patterns of generational support  The conclusion considers the implications of these results for understand ing the basis of radical right popularity  and for the stability and longevity of these parties
