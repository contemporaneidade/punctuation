The paper investigates the policy of solidarity economy in the federal government  implemented since 2003 with the creation of the National Secretariat of Solidarity Economy  SENAES  Based on the theoretical model of Kingdon  1995  the article examines  first  the political process  in a broad sense  who succeeded his inclusion as a public policy to generate jobs and income  Next  we analyze the projects and actions developed in the program between 2003 and 2010  with emphasis on their guidelines  internal structure  budget allocation and executionFinally  the article analyzes also what the main partners of SENAES these years to the development of other programs that interface with the solidarity economy  and thus could improve the adherence of the subject within the government  The analysis suggests that the model of Kingdon explains the process of inserting the solidarity economy as public policy in 2003  although this insertion is only one stage of the cycle  Defined its constitution rules  there is a dispute of the program within the government  past eight years  there was no effective intervention of the government to the point of consolidating the socio economic practices   broadcast by solidarity economy   as a strategy for entering the real world work  or even create an institutional environment that encourages the formalization of associative economic groups  Despite its low budget allocation compared to other programs MTE  the PESD was not constituted as a referral program to a new development strategy  even if the SENAES has managed to coalesce around their important social and political forces for the defense of solidarity economy as a public policy  It shows and discusses the integration of policies and conduct of solidarity economy in the federal government  revealing that the issue did not rise to the macro political  gravitating in a marginal field  outside the core  in search of space for your internal valuation  While it is regarded merely as a palliative alternative to the problem of unemployment  can hardly meet the antagonisms and conflicts of interest that prevent their development
