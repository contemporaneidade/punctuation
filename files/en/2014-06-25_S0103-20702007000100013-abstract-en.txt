This paper presents the main research findings of a study conducted in two industrial districts and what I refer to here as Local Industrial Arrangements   LIAs  The research focuses on the transition from a situation characterized by informal or illegal production  low wages and precarious work conditions  to one characterized by high levels of productivity quality fair labour conditions  The findings of the empirical study reveal the importance of specific institutions in the transition from a widespread informality to the more stable and sustainable situation of the LIAs  In the case of Jaragu   GO  it was the legal framework that enabled this change and the subsequent impact on local development  while in the case of Toritama  PE  transition was stimulated by the cooperation between legal and environmental institutions
