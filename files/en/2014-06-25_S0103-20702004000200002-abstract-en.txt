The main characteristic of new economic sociology  which has been mor and more prestiged in the USA and Europe recently  is to study markets as social constructions rather than as abstract balance mechanisms  Far from opposing to economic science procedures  this trend is shared by some of its most influential exponents  It is true that contemporary economics corresponds to the widely believed reputation that it is a grey and mechanical science  unable to incorporate ethical principles to its basis  However  an important part of economics is geared towards the study of concrete ways of social interaction  and questions the merelyselfish and maximizing motivations axiomatically postulated by the neoclassical tradition  Among these currents new institutional economics stands out  Its issues are the object of new economic sociology  In spite of their different approaches  both contribute to prevent markets from being faced as magical solutions to all social problems or as demonized ways of interaction which human emancipation will eventually do away it
