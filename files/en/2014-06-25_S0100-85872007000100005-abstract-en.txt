This paper deals with the emergence and transformation of the categories  Yoruba  and  Yorubaness  as collectively salient predicates of social identities and religious practices on both sides of the Atlantic  Arguing against anachronistic scholarly attributions of origins  I detail how such origins  identities  and religions were actively fashioned in twentieth century Nigeria  Cuba and Brazil in the course of temporally staggered ethnogenetic and ecclesiogenetic processes that involved complex interactions between religious practitioners  ethnographers and state agents  as well as textual mediations and intertextualities between ethnographic and hierographic genres  I conclude by briefly surveying the latest phase in this process  marked as it is by the transformation of  orisha worship  into what arguably is an emergent universal religion
