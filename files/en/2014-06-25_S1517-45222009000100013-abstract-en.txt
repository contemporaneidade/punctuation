This article discusses the multiple meanings of violence identified by researchers  comparing them to empirical studies conducted in a mid size city in Rio Grande do Sul  Brazil  Subsequently  it considers the absence of these various meanings  both in the television show and in the perception of the people surveyed  as well as the presence of stereotypes in the construction of the television messages and its interpretations  Furthermore  the article intends to present more data to explain the perception of the interviewed people on the increase in violence within the local context  To conclude  the author questions the culture of fear  suggesting that it can be powered not only by the apprehension of the people surveyed who watch the TV show  but also by the way some researchers analyze the same show  The discussion aims to show that there are reified conceptions of violence  image and reality  within the debate  that give power to the perception of an increase in violence and the resulting sense of insecurity
