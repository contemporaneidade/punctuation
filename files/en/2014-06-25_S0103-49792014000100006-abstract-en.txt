Interpretations of the labor theory of value face difficulties in defining the role and place of service activities with relation to the production or not of value  This problem becomes even more pronounced while historic perspective shows that nowadays services are the great employers of labor  Traditionally  services can be understood as non productive activities  due to the fact  amongst other arguments  that they are not materialized as commodities  or that they do not produce new values and surplus value  This paper aims to examine this issue and suggest the proposition that some services that meet specific conditions can be interpreted as productive in terms of value and surplus value  This paper examines the categories of materiality and immateriality  as well as those of productive and non productive labor of value  then introducing criteria to make the distinction between productive and non productive labor of value in the service sector  Thus  it intends to contribute to clarify the understanding of the labor theory of value in a field intercrossed with discussions and differentiated theoretical standpoints
