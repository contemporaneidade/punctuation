If in his article Cal via affirms that missionary failures must be qualified  Saez 1999  the same is true for its success cases  I analise here the attempts to civilize and convert the Munduruku indians made by missionaries from the Miss o de S o Francisco  using the missionary discourse to investigate the franciscan categories used to describe their work  characterized not by munduruku inconstancy but for a strong adherence that  for the missionaries  reflected the successful relationship built with the indigenous population  In this context  I return to Cal via s proposal to understand civilization less as historical event and more as a fluid category for the missionary agencies
