Based on Georgina de Albuquerque s painting  Session of the Council of State  I intend to discuss the relationship between women painters and the Brazilian Academy of Fine Arts  analysing how  during the 19th century  these women were excluded from the possibility of accessing the highest degrees of recognition within the academic system  historic painting  Coincidentally  the first historic painting by a Brazilian woman dates exactly from the year that marks the decline of the Academy  1922  If it is analysed based on the genre s prerogatives  Georgina de Albuquerque s work can be considered daring  It is a historic painting and at the same time it is conservative  if its analysis is based on stylistic criteria  Therefore  this work may be interpreted as  discreetly daring  if considered from an aesthetic  institutional  educational or even sexual perspective
