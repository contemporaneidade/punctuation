From his research among Malaysian peasants  James C  Scott develops the concept of  everyday forms of resistance  which express the prosaic and constant struggle between members of the subordinate classes and those who seek to extract labor  food  taxes  rents  and interest from them  Such forms of resistance express themselves in foot dragging  dissimulation  false compliance  pilfering  feigned ignorance  slander  arson  sabotage  and so forth  Hence  the absence of more visible forms of political opposition  as rebellions or strikes  does not reflect an ideological  hegemony  and a passive acceptation of the established order by those subjected to domination  Instead  it reflects circumstances   that are rather the rule   in which an open and organized action would be too dangerous
