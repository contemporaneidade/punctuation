In this paper I compare race targeted affirmative action policies in higher education in Brazil and South Africa  A few questions guide this comparison  Why are countries with completely different racial structures and histories currently implementing similar policies to address racial inequality  And  more specifically  why did Brazil   a country with historically less rigid racial boundaries than South Africa   implement a more radical form of affirmative action than South Africa  How do these different national understandings of race influence the implementation and debates about race targeted affirmative action  And  maybe more importantly  how do these  imported  policies influence the above mentioned national contexts
