This paper examines the predicament of the postcolonial nation state through the prism of environmental catastrophe  how is it that plant  invaders  can become an urgent political issue  and what might this reveal of the shifting relations among citizenship  community  and national sovereignty under neo liberal conditions  Pursuing these questions in relation to a case from the  new  South Africa  we posit three key features of postcolonial polities in an era of laissez faire  the refiguration of the subject citizen  the crisis of sovereign borders  and the depoliticization of politics  Under such conditions  aliens   both plants and people   come to embody core contradictions of boundedness and belonging  and alien nature provides a language for voicing new forms of discrimination amidst a culture of  post racism  and civil rights
