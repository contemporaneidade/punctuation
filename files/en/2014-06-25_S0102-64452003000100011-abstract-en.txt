On the basis of a view of institutions as mediating between structures and individual behavior it is argued that the same basic development of institutionalism can be found in Political Science as well as in Economics or Sociology  according to three analytical currents  each with its own genealogy  In French economic theory these three currents correspond to the regulation theory  to the new institutional theory  and to the convention theory  Basically the new institutionalisms differ according to two great oppositions  1  the weight given  in the genesis of institutions  either to conflicts of power and interests or to the coordination between individuals  2  the role attributed either to a strictly instrumental rationality or to representations and culture
