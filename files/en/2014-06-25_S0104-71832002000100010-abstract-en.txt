I discuss some processes of identity formation in relation to local forms of civil mobilization and voluntary association within the context of the AIDS epidemic since the mid 1980s  These processes have been maintained through different factors  such as gender  sexual identity and illness  I focus on a range of identities associated to health and illness  clinical identities  On the one hand  they involve broad cultural processes and social dynamics of stigmatization and symbolic violence  On the other hand  they involve the maintenance of health structures  but also social responses and demands  My major analytical question was how a social process caused by the predicament of the AIDS epidemic has contructed particular models of identity  Therefore this research focuses on the emergence  the maintenance and the conflicting relations between different processes and models of identity formation  particularly on the ways in which identities are socially circulated and performed
