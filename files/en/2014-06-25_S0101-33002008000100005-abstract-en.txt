In Brazil  the analysis of statistics shows that crime and criminality data are produced and that they are part of our criminal justice system history  Nevertheless  these data are not transformed into information and knowlegde  even after the re democratization of the country  The raising amount of produced data  which results from the technological modernization of the state  causes the opacity of excessive exposure and allows the circulation of transparency discourses without the occurence of actual changes in governmental rules and practices  To sum up  the re definition of those statistics role does not rely on technical aspects  which are controlable and depend on decision making  it relies on political aspects that can attribute responsibilities and resolve conflicts
