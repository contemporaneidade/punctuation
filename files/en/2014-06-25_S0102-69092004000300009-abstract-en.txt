This article focus on the critical contribution of Bourdieu to the studies of kinship  particularly the so called matrimonial switches and celibacy  His interpretations on the endogamic Berber marriage and the celibacy in the French peasantry allowed him to formulate the criticism on the juridical formality and the  genealogical  perception of kinship  In such studies  Bourdieu puts aside the notion of rule to consider kinship a practice  At the same time  still based on the concept of habitus  the author understands the matrimonial switches as a game  more than a structure  and that granted him permission to move from the idea of society to that one of countryside  Bourdieu also criticizes a na ve perception of the  native point of view  pointing towards the distinction between the public and private discourse
