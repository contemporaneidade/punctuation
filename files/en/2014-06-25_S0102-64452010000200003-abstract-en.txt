This article analyzes how Roberto Mangabeira Unger develops his work toward the effort to imagine new institutional arrangements and to define programmatic proposals  The concept that best describes this intersection between explanatory thinking and institutional imagination is democratic experimentalism  directed at the economic and political spheres  I argue that this effort in Unger s thinking contributes toward diminishing the historical difficulty that the left political thought has always had with the institutional question  In doing so  Unger attempts to rehabilitate the idea that the continuous reinvention of institutions is the democracy s basis
