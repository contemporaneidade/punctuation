Many different formulas have been attempted in order to promote smoother connections between foreign policy and democracy within contemporary national societies  but difficulties to accommodate them remain paramount  This article investigates  both from ontological and historical perspectives  how plausible it is nowadays to conduct a  democratic foreign policy  The argument relies on empirical data from countries that have actually associated in some way foreign policy with democracy  be they in Northern or Southern hemisphere  The author intends to demonstrate that the  democratic foreign policy proposal is no longer to be seen as a logical contradiction  an oxymoron  nor as an impossible political arrangement  a chimera  as it seemed to be the case in the 20th century  Nonetheless  one can still identify a myriad of practical obstacles when trying to make the two categories   democracy and foreign policy   work in tandem
