This article aims at providing a consideration of the issue of modernity in Brazil by means of a critical analysis of two of the main strands in the Brazilian social thought  namely the so called dependency sociological approach and the patrimonial patriarchal heritage strand  It argues in favor of a broadened conceptual framework capable of grasping variations in the three pillars of modern sociability  that is  social differentiation  secularization  and the public private divide  The ultimate goal is setting the terrain for dealing with the constitution of modern sociability as a contingent process resulting from contentions among disputing projects  interests  and world views  which fight for the control of the social order
