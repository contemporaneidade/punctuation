The relationships between culture and politics have gained new contours in Brazil since the 1990s  The cultural explosion of the urban periphery   with rap in the forefront   expressed itself in a dualistic logic that split society into blacks and whites  wealthier city centers and the poorer periphery  the  bros  and the  playboys  This dualistic view  in turn  reflects a manner of thinking shackled to the immediate present   in this case  the abstract refusal of the  establishment  The same modus operandi could be seen in the middle class that took to the streets in the so called June Days of 2013  Driven by the logic of the spectacle and manipulated by the media  the June Days also expressed  in the other edge of society  an aestheticization of politics that reenacted  in its own way  its persistence in the visible  immediate present
