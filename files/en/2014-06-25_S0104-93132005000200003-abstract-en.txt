Launching a reanalysis of the literature concerning  Guarani religion  this article explores how and in which directions it has transformed since the 16th century to eventually recreate itself as the contemporary  Guarani religion  described by 20th century ethnology  The background to this analysis is a critical reading of the notion of a  Guarani way of being  founded on a religiosity impervious to change  The article suggests that contact with Mission Christianity and the colonial experience led to the gradual negation of cannibalism as the basis of shamanic power and social reproduction a process here termed  dejaguarization  This process led to changes in the Guarani notion of personhood and enabled the emergence of a new way of conceiving the human relationship to animals and divinities  a relationship henceforth founded on a native category of love
