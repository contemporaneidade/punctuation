This essay examines the song  The Girl from Ipanema  by Jobim   Vinicius in tandem with a poem by Sappho   Ode to Anactoria   7th century b C  which contains a verse that says  literally   This way of walking that awakens desire  Taking the cue  I establish comparisons between other fragments by Sappho and this paradigmatic Brazilian song  dated 1962  Even with the greatest respect for the historicity of affection  to avoid anachronisms  we nevertheless find surprising invariances in their counterpoint  regardless of the 27 century hiatus  Between Sappho and Jobim Vinicius  however  there is Freud   or rather  Jensen and his Gradiva  which speaks  precisely  of the walk of the desired woman  On the other hand  musicologist Almir Chediak sees a parallel between the melodic design of the score of  The Girl from Ipanema  and the ebb and flow of the waves of the sea  In the accompanying graph  we can indeed discern this iconic rhythm  The waves  the undulating gait  the rhythm  the basic theme   o balan o a caminho do mar   i e  the girl s cool swinging and gentle swaying as she walks to the sea  all converge in this most Brazilian of songs  in which we nevertheless find a very alluring recurrence of archaic Greek lyric poetry
