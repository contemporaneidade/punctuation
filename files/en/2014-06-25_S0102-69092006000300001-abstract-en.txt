The article discusses the contributions made by seven natural scientists   Paul Sears  Aldo Leopold  Rachel Carson  Paul Ehrlich  Donella Meadows  Garrett Hardin  and James Lovelock to the establishment of the contemporary environmental agenda  It argues that almost every major issue in this agenda was brought up and publicized originally by natural scientists  Social scientists interested in these issues were latecomers  mostly because they held on to the  human exemption paradigm  Sometimes they also ignore the contributions of their colleagues in the natural sciences  a flaw that affects negatively the quality of their own endeavors  The article proposes that social scientists and natural scientists should deepen their exchanges on environmental matters
