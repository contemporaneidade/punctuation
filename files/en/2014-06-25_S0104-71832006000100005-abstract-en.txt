Some of the most important recent transformations in the ecological paradigm are the development of transdisciplinary syntheses between the social and natural sciences  the heuristic proposal of epistemological symmetry and the methodological dialogue with complexity studies  These transformations form the groundwork for a discussion of the contributions of anthropology to the new field of study of political ecology  After the delimitation of the sub field of the  ethnography of socioenvironmental conflicts  the specific practices of multi actor ethnography  which identifies and differentiates between social and natural agents  and of the use of multiple spatial and temporal levels of analysis are delineated  The article ends with a brief discussion of the academic  critical and policy implications of political ecology research
