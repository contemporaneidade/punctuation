This article examines the relations between residents of the French suburbs and the police   or more precisely  the population formed by generations of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants  It attempts to explain why the militancy of the children of immigrants is infrequently considered and recognized as such by municipal left wing groups  in particular the Communist Party  PC  which runs numerous local councils in the French suburbs even today  Based on long term ethnographic research conducted in the 1990s and an analysis of the situation of Gennevilliers  the town where the research was carried out  the author develops two lines of reasoning to explain the divorce between the political left and the residents of the suburbs  Firstly  the stereotypical image of the children of immigrant Algerians and Moroccans  which makes them appear a category apart   foreign youths   second generation immigrants   problematic populations  And secondly  the urban history of left wing municipalities over the last fifty years  in particular the circumstances behind the evolution of large housing estates in the industrial outskirts  Combining these two readings allows us to an insight into the situation of the working class districts  today doubly disinherited  at an economic level  as is frequently emphasized  and at a political level  a factor more rarely noted
