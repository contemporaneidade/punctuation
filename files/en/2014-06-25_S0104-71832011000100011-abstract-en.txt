The article aims to reflect on the implications of the presence of the category of belief in modernity  Formed in a critical project  which led to its ontological weakening  the notion of belief was fundamental to the modern definition of religion  On the other hand  modernity did not fail to positively incorporate the same notion  which is evident in its stated commitment to the principle of  freedom of belief  The text establishes connections between the senses of the modern definition of belief and the modern construction of the notion of society  In this exploration  themes as freedom and subjection and situations are considered  as well situations as the status of credulity and blasphemy  Its course and its outcome are set in dialogue with the work of two authors  Bruno Latour and Talal Asad
