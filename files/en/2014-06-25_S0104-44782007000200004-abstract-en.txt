Our intention is to present a re reading of the problem of the State in Gramsci 39 s thought  in the wake of Massimo Salvadori and Christine Buci Gluksmann now classic analyses  guided by our conviction that Gramsci 39 s supposedly perfect alignment to the Marxist perspective on the extinction of the State   sustained almost unanimously by contemporary Gramscian criticism   should be re evaluated and even revoked  We work exegetically with Gramsci 39 s text  using tools of lexical analysis and paying particular attention to the presence of the expression  state life  of which he makes ample use in his in his Quaderni del carcere  Several elements capable of clarifying the Gramscian conception of the State flow from this expression  They are useful in our reconsideration of his complex reflections on the  historic  problem of democracy  with its fragile balance between critique  renovation and exclusion of the traditional forms of modern democracy
