Rooted in ethnographic findings  this article wants to show that structuring forces are still present among the changes observed in the poor territories of S o Paulo  even when invisible  modulated by the mix between the processes identified as global changes and its local developments  like the impact of the so called  Chinese cost  in work relations  In a European context  the global processes may have the meaning of porosity and traffic among frontiers  international migrations  trade means crossing formal and informal poles of circulation and consumption  In the east of S o Paulo it is possible to observe other modulations of these processes  Part of them have taken place with a silent and invisible transformation of urban territories  mixing the so called  world of housing  and the  world of work
