The purpose of this paper is to address religion in the framework of Luhmann s systems theory in order to identify some of its ambiguities and internal contradictions  The specificity of religion lays in the fact that taking part in religious communication depends rigidly on the actual engagement of consciousness through faith  what diminishes its capability of preserving its system environment difference  We present religion as a specific case for functional differentiation because it takes place as a reaction against the functional differentiation of non religious systems of society and as some privatization of the religious experience  We refer to the sociology of Weber in order to illustrate historically our argumentation  In conclusion  we provide a brief conceptual adjustment capable of suiting the systems theory to the observation of religious phenomena in the contemporary society
