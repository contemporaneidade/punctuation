The predominance of Eurocentric or US centric perspectives in the social sciences has strengthened the belief that there is an exclusive model of modernity  experienced firstly in the economic centers of the world  and only later adopted in the  peripheries  The same logics can be found in studies of blackness in Brazil which have frequently characterized the black experience in the U S A  as the most  modern  within the African Diaspora  In this article  I attempt a theoretical reflection which aims to overcome the centrality of the United States in the studies of negritude  recovering the notion of the African Diaspora as a multi centered configuration  In order to do so  I examine the position of the city of Salvador da Bahia as an important center for the formation of the modern world  as well as for the construction of contemporary black identities
