Analysis of the original social positions of party leaders shows that the present mechanisms of political recruitment tend to favour the upper classes of society  but that each party encourages the ascent of different fractions of these classes  The contrasts between parties which structure the functioning of the political spectrum thus appear to duplicate  quite independently moreover  the internal structures of the upper classes  The differences between the leaders of the PCF and PS on one hand  and the RPR and UDF on the other  bear a strong resemblance  for example  to the contrast between the intellectual and economic poles of these classes  Similarly  when these parties recruit in other strata  the PCF and PS tend to recruit officials in lower dominated positions  whereas the UDF and RPR prefer to recruit officials in senior dominant positions  This pattern of homologies also explains the logic behind recruitment aimed at the middle and popular classes  and allows a few assumptions to be made concerning the mechanism of political influence and representation
