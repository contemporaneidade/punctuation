This paper examines the relationship between word and image and the consequences both for the development of art and for the relationship between criticism and art  It shows how an ever growing mixture of pictorial  image  and poetic  word  registers at the basis of image rhetoric is cultivated and deepened by advertising  The invasion of the image by the conceptual register of the word strengthens the classical dichotomy between sensitive and intelligible  leading to a limitation of the imagination
