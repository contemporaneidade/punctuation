The purpose of this paper is to present a brief history of the academic studies on nutrition in ancient Egypt   and its relation with Gender Studies  Previous studies on eating habits by Egyptologists have disregarded the aspect of gender and the role of women  mainly focusing on religion and funerary practices  However  Gender Studies have articulated food production and the domestic role of women in Egypt  Archaeological discoveries and the development of a critical attitude by Egyptologists have contributed to deconstruct anachronistic theoretical models for women and gender relations as well as removed Egyptology from its own isolationism
