The purpose of this paper is to evaluate critically the latest general review of the field of the anthropology of religion practiced in Brazil and which was published in the anthology Horizons of the Social Sciences in Brazil  Martins and Duarte 2010  One of the main points that we highlight for discussion in this article is the effect of the homogenization of this field of research in Brazil as it is promoted by the review under scrutiny  This equalization passes over a significant part of the work done in the North and Northeast of Brazil  leaving it invisible  and hence affecting  more fundamentally  the evaluation of the state of the area of research  In a response  we change the focus of analysis and reverse the map  turn it up side down  Taking the literature produced in the North and the Northeast as the focus of our reflection  we identify some  local agenda  that actually are in dialogue with  and participates in  the contemporary national and international agendas  In conclusion  both as an ethnographic area and as an academic contribution to the literature  the North and the Northeast distinctively contribute significantly to the national and international field of the anthropology of religion
