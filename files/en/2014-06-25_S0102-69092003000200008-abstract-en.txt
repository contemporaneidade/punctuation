This essay aims to analyze the evolution of the Brazilian economical and institutional scene that has both produced a new relationship among big corporations  shareholders  and commission agents  and spread its consequences over unions and the security service  The article points the vicissitudes of the attempts to install the corporative governance model in Brazil  using the parceled chambers as a cognitive counterpoint  It shows also some particularities on the recent dealings with laws that regulate the corporative governance  focusing on the difficulties faced by the agents who have attempted to bring such concept  natural of the Anglo Saxon finance community  to the Brazilian scene  The discussion intends to show that  from one point of view the difficulties are an expression of the Brazilian capitalism model  which has currently undertaken a process of delegitimization caused by the prevalence of those who favor globalization  taken as the organic intellectuals of the current dominating elites  from another  it shows that the  globalizing  actors have received a decisive and somewhat unexpected help from the high ranks of the union movement  which by all means greatly influences the economic and political dispute fought around the implementation or not of the corporative governance and its boundaries
