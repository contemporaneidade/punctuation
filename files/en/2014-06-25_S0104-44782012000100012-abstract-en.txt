This article analyzes the legislative process and performance in 12 Brazilian state legislative assemblies during two legislative periods  1999 2002 and 2002 2006  Our initial goal was to provide a perspective on the volume and dynamics of legislative production through identification of determining aspects of decision making processes and analysis of certain indicators  such as the volume of the projects presented and the success rate of bills and vetoes  We also look at the content of the proposals presented by governors and state representatives  using this variation to problematize the state legislative process  As a result  some interpretative considerations can be made  Thus  in the first place we see that the legislative dynamic of state assemblies depends on the institutional resources that are constitutionally conferred upon political actors by the Federal Constitution  which in turn restricts the legislation that state representatives are able to propose and limits governor s legislative autonomy  Yet this does not annul the differentiation process that springs from different political party perspectives  Rather  we have a clear indication that political party dynamics and effective interaction between government and opposition within assemblies explain the variation encountered between states  In the second place  our data show that there is a diversified state legislative dynamic that is not annulled by Executive power  The volume of proposals presented by state representatives that do not distribute concentrated benefits are an indication of a  desired  agenda  geared primarily toward defining norms and directives of state public policy  Yet at the same time  we see that although the legislative success of state representatives is high when compared to that of federal representatives  it is basically limited to one type of norm  concession of concentrated benefits  among which public utility declarations stand out  Our research efforts and the data presented here should call attention to the need for future research on state assemblies  seeking a better understanding of the way Brazilian institutions work within the sub national ambit
