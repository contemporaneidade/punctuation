This article discusses aspects of the global local relations  focusing on the process of formation and development of the Gravata  automotive complex and its social implications as related to the labor relations and employment in local companies  In accordance with the recent formation of the global system  it is assumed that the presence of global agents in local contexts creates new social dynamics that depend on specific arrangements between economic and institutional circumstances  levels and types of available social and economic resources  and strategies mobilized by social agents  The global agents would impose new competitive and technological references to the local agents  who would often be unprepared to meet such requirements  On the other hand  there could be alternative ways of providing access to capital  markets  technologies and knowledge  encouraging changes in labor relations and employment at the local level  The asymmetry in the relations of economic power would not prevent the local agents from reacting to the new rules and conditions of the international system  in accordance with the possibilities offered by their resources and the limits of their values  Thus  the global local relation would have different implications among the social agents
