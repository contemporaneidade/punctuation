This article aims at analyzing the concept of Marx on true democracy as developed especially in the Critique of Hegel s Philosophy of Right  in order to indicate how he poses himself as the  resolved enigma  for modern ways of political organization  In doing so  the article argues that such enigma points towards the contradiction between state and civil society  which for Marx constitutes the main characteristic of political modernity  It consequently also argues that a solution revealed to the enigma of the  true democracy  implies in overcoming contradiction  what can only happen through the instauration of a new place for politics  the real community founded on free association of equally free men
