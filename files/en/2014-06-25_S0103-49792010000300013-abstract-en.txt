This paper examines the perception of construction workers in a context of social vulnerability  marked by the increasing precariousness of employment contracts  Twenty workers from S o Carlos  Brazil  were interviewed  recovering their trajectories of work  Through qualitative analysis of the interviews  it was possible to verify the vulnerability and varied forms of employment contracts and remuneration  Despite the precariousness of labor relations  half of the workers claim to be professionally fulfilled in their occupation  while the other half perceive themselves to be diminished in society by the lack of schooling  or identify themselves with former occupations  seeing construction as a passing step or as the last option left to them
