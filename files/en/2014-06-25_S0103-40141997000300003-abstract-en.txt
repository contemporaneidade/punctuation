The purpose of this text is to discuss the complex process of the Brazilian agrarian camp formation under the account of the data presented by the I Censo da Reforma Agr ria do Brasil  This text intends to show that the building of a new way of life by the settled people is very beyond the mere polemic of the numbers  all entailing relativity  Although its importance can not be denied  it must be observed that the census itself does not show the reality of the encampments  their problems  their difficulties  their strategies of permanence in the areas  and their conviction as  social produced space  The publication of this census  however urges us to the countless issues involving the very serious problem of land property in Brazil
