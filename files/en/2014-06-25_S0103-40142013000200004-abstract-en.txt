The paper aims to assess trends in the prevalence and social distribution of child stunting in Brazil to evaluate the effect of income and basic service redistribution policies implemented in that country in the recent past  The prevalence of stunting  height for age z score below  2 using the Child Growth Standards of the World Health Organization  among children aged less than five years was estimated from data collected during national household surveys carried out in Brazil in 1974 1975  n   34 409  1989  n   7 374  1996  n   4 149  and 2006 07  n   4 414  Absolute and relative socioeconomic inequality in stunting was measured by means of the slope index and the concentration index of inequality  respectively  Over a 33 year period  we documented a steady decline in the national prevalence of stunting from 37 1  to 7 1  Prevalence dropped from 59 0  to 11 2  in the poorest quintile and from 12 1  to 3 3  among the wealthiest quintile  The decline was particularly steep in the last ten years of the period  1996 to 2007  when the gaps between poor and wealthy families with children under five were also reduced in terms of purchasing power  access to education  health care and water and sanitation services  and reproductive health indicators  In Brazil  socioeconomic development coupled with equity oriented public policies have been accompanied by marked improvements in living conditions and a substantial decline in child undernutrition  as well as a reduction of the gap in nutritional status between children in the highest and lowest socioeconomic quintiles  Future studies will show whether these gains will be maintained under the current global economic crisis
