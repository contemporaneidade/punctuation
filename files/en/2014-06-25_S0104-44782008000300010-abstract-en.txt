This article focuses on explanations for sequential faults in administrative reform  It deals with the limits of managerial adjustment in an approach that attempts to connect theory and empirical data  articulating three levels of analysis  The first level presents comparative evidence of sequential fault within reforms in national governments through a set of indicators geared toward understanding changes in the role of the state  In light of analyses of a representative set of comparative studies on reform implementation  the second analytical level proceeds to identify four typical mechanisms that are present in explanations on managerial adjustment faults  In this way  we seek to configure an explanatory matrix for theories on sequential fault  Next we discuss the experience of management reform in the Brazilian context  conferring special attention on one of the mechanisms that creates fault  the control dilemma  The major hypotheses that guide our article are that reforms lead to sequential fault and that there are at least four causal mechanisms that produce reforms  a  transactions costs involved in producing reforms  b  performance legacy  c  predominance of fiscal adjustment and d  the control dilemma  These mechanisms act separately or in concert  and act to decrease chances for a transformation of State managerial patterns  Major evidence that is analyzed in these articles lend consistency to the general argument that reforms have failed in their attempts to reduce public expenses  alter patterns of resource allocation  reduce the labor force and change the role of the State  Our major conclusion is that reforms fail sequentially and managerial adjustment displays considerable limitations  particularly those of a political nature
