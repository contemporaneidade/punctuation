This paper analyzes the characteristics of the fiscal policy in Lula s government  emphasizing its content and decision making style in a comparative perspective  both with prior governments and between his two terms in office  The analysis is contextualized in the framework of the challenges introduced by the international integration model adopted in Brazil during the 1990s and by the expansion of social demands brought by the new democratic order  In spite of limits imposed by financial markets that ask for credibility  fiscal restrictions and high levels of primary surplus  the paper points out that there is room to orienting the fiscal policy towards other goals  economic growth and internal demand stimulus by means of income transfer programs  That was made possible  to a great extent  by the expansion of governmental decision making arenas and by the adoption of a style of decision making based more on negotiations
