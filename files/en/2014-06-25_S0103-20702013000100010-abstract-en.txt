The  markets  comprise one of the largest  black boxes  of the present era  attributed with god like powers that mysteriously determine the fates of contemporary societies  In this article I make use of some of the peculiarities of this situation in Brazil  especially the forms in which the financial crisis has been confronted  to suggest an analytic path capable of objectifying the zone of social space that we call the market and to show some of its recent developments  thereby rendering this reality sociologically comprehensible  In this sense the exploration of the  Brazilian case  is exceptionally elucidative in terms of revealing a chronology that provides a much more nuanced view of the taken for granted autonomy of the financial world
