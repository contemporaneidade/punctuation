This paper explores some dimensions of the production and use of the  low spiritualism   baixo espiritismo  category  parting from an analysis of the category s temporality and of its users  We show how  in the context of the spiritualism outlawing by the 1890 Brazilian Penal Code  an opposition between false and truly spiritual practices was construed by both religious agents and journalistic views  This opposition is crystallized in repressive police action  an action corroborated by the interaction of spiritual religious groups  The paper analyzes the first half of the twentieth century and we hope its results can contribute with the elucidation of the mechanisms through which the social insertion and legitimization of certain religious practices took place
