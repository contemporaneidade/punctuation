The fact that there is a political sociology to be found in Durkheim has caused polemic and is a controversial matter  in Brazil as well as France  particularly because this sub field does not appear within the author s own division of Sociology into sub areas  This paper argues that there are elements that enable us to recognize a Durkheimian political sociology  This is concretized through a detailed examination of the theoretical evolution of his thought since he returned from Germany in 1886  Following in the tracks of Marcel Mauss  who analyzed his work  and picking up as well from where his most important biographers  Lukes and Fournier  leave off  we look at how themes that are properly political  in particular  the State  emerge within Durkheimian sociology  We conclude by asserting that it is not through reflection on the issue of power  or the State  in itself  but rather on the social function of this power and or this State and its relationship to social mores that Durkheim s political sociology should be understood
