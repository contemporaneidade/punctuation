By interrelating two lines of analysis  one having to do with the city and the other with ethnography  this paper seeks to discuss possibilities which are opened by an anthropological approach to the study of urban dynamics Discussion of analytical charts for study of contemporary urban phenomena allows for a characterization of what may be termed as an  outsider and long distanced view  A contrasting  insider and close up view  is outlined  Theoretical presuppositions are explicated and research strategy is proposed  As a way o demonstration  recent ethnographic examples are used  Finally  it is suggested that a  distanced  view may effectively broaden and complement the proposed perspective  making possible an articulated project involving well delimited ethnographic research design and more general levels and models of analysis
