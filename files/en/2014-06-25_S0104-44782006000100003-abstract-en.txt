Attending to Bourdieu s early field studies conducted concurrently in colonial Algeria and in his childhood village of B arn in southwestern France sets his scientific approach and output into a new light  it reveals the twinned ethnographic roots of his theoretical enterprise  it dissolves the caricatural figure of the  reproduction theorist  oblivious to historical change  and it dispels the academic fiction of the  practice theorist  by displaying how Bourdieu s conceptual innovations  such as the reintroduction of habitus  were driven by questions of field research centered on social transformation  cultural disjuncture  and the fissuring of consciousness  Using each site as a living laboratory to cross analyze the other enabled Bourdieu to discover the specificity of the  universally prelogical logic of practice  and led him to break out of the structuralist paradigm  Recoupling his youthful inquiries in Kabylia and B arn further reveals how  foreshadowing the  repatriation  of anthropology after the close of the imperial age  Bourdieu revoked the dominant conception of ethnography as a heroic exploration of otherness and pioneered multi sited ethnography as a means for controlling the construction of the object  Bourdieu s paired field studies of social structure and sentiment in the far away colony and the mother country not only efface in practice the disciplinary division between sociology and anthropology  They demonstrate that one can conduct  insider ethnography  and acknowledge the social embeddedness and split subjectivity of the inquirer without reducing ethnography to story telling and forsaking social theory for poetry
