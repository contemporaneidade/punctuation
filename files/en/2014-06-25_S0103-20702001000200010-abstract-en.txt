This paper is a concise intellectual portrait of Niklas Luhmann focusing mainly on his social theory  it highlights the ideas found in The society of society that reveal the constructivist nucleus of modern social systems theory  By discussing the central distinctions of that work  between system and environment  the authors identify the basic breaking off points of Luhmann s theory with regard to the classical cognitive model of the European tradition and its humanist cosmology  Then  they present three basic conceptions of his sociological analysis  society without people  society as communication  and society as world society  Finally  they present some critical thoughts on the possibilities and limits of post ontological theory of society as a self referential system
