This paper examines the question of subjectivity in the workplace and the central role of work in the construction of subjects and their mental health  in light of advances in the psychodynamics of work  One of the most recurrent issues appearing in studies and initiatives in this field is the invisibility of work  the lack of recognition from others  especially corporate hierarchies  Different ways of organizing work privilege distinct and partial views of people  ignoring the existence of the subject  The concept of pathic rationality helps distinguish a view of the worker s subjectivity in which lived experience is central  The subject looks for meaning in a process of self realization within a collective  striving to ensure that the end results of the work are as good as possible
