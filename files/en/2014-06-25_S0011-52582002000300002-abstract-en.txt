In this work we apply quantitative methods to recover the individual preferences of Brazilian representatives  as expressed in their nominal votes in the 49th and 50th legislatures  The method assumes both the rational choice and spatial theories of voting  Empirical analyses show that Brazilian representatives can be accurately positioned in a single ideological continuum that reflects  in part  the consensus of Brazilian politics observers  members of the Partido dos Trabalhadores  PT   Workers  Party  are positioned at the extreme left and those of the Frente Liberal  PFL   Liberal Front  at the opposite end  The Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira  PSDB   Party of the Brazilian Social Democracy  in turn  moved from a center left position in the 49th legislature to the right  in the 50th  Additional dimensions contribute very little to the explanatory capacity of the model  The spatial positioning of representatives of a same party vary significantly  and the paramount quality of the statistical model used is its capacity to provide us with a spatial interpretation of this variation  The first dimension is rather stable in both legislatures  Circumstantial evidence is raised to support the hypothesis that these dimensions reflect the relationship between the Executive and the Legislative branches of government  During this period  the Presidents of the Republic were located at the extreme right of the political space
