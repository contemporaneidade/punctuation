Inequality can be produced in four basic ways  First there is distantiation   some people are running ahead and or others falling behind  Secondly there is the mechanism of exclusion   through which a barrier is erected making it impossible  or at least more difficult  for certain categories of people to access a good life  Thirdly  the institutions of hierarchy mean that societies and organisations are constituted as ladders  with some people perched on top and others below  Finally  there is exploitation  in which the riches of the rich derive from the toil and the subjection of the poor and the disadvantage  In this article  we shall look into the ways in which current inequalities are being produced
