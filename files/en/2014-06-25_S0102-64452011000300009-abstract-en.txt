The current study argues that the development of conflictiv relationships between Participatory Budgeting  PB  the Executive  the Legislative  and parties in the area of municipal government  in part explain the variations in reach of these participatory experiments  It compares three experiments in PB carried out in the interior of the state of S o Paulo   Mat o  Rio Claro  and S o Carlos   that are similar in various ways  but which are distinguished by the variation in the trajectory of their PB programs  continuous  discontinuous  and broken  in the last three municipal administrations  In sum  it concludes that the patterns in conflictual relationships and cooperation between the studied local political actors contribute to the varying scope of PB  as to the emergence of new local political designs
