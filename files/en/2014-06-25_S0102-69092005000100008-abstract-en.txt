This text aims to revive  in an exploratory manner  some of the pioneering reflections of Durkheim and Weber in relation to the market  From the viewpoint of the current excitement in the field of the new economic sociology  we argue that Durkheim and Weber were responsible for originating the sociological study of the market as a social structure  In fact  they both showed that economic interests and the means by which they may be adequately pursued are defined socially  by institutions  In particular  traditional  moral and legal rules are seen as basic conditions for the regulation of the market  Moreover  giving rise to a reflection which today is seen as fundamental  both pointed towards the role of the State  the importance of which consists less in a direct regulation of the economy than in the diffusion of essential social values
