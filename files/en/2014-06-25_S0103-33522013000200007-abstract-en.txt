To know the social world and analyze it always means to get involved in it  as opposed to what happens in natural or hard sciences  Therefore  to think about the assumptions  rules and consequences of knowledge production is the primary duty of the scientific community  This paper sets out to explore the different dimensions of the issue and proceeds to demonstrate that in an increasingly complex world in social and technological terms  it becomes crucial to define the relations connecting the researcher and social world and to justify research practices by resorting to guiding principles and norms  Beyond exploring the metatheoretical assumptions and different paradigms that frame this probl matique  the paper describes and analyzes the efforts to govern social research in the international arena since 1945
