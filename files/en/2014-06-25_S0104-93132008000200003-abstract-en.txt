This text is concerned with a specific Indigenous category   usually translated as  owner  or  master    which  in Amazonia  transcends the simple expression of a relationship of property or domain  The category and its reciprocal terms designate a generalized mode of relating that characterizes interactions between humans  between non humans  between humans and non humans and between persons and things  It is a key category for understanding Indigenous sociologies and cosmologies  which  notwithstanding its importance  has received relatively little attention  Through the analysis of ethnographical evidence  this text seeks to explore the consequences of imagining the Amerindian universe as a world of owners and the owner as a model for the magnified person  in order to discuss notions of ownership  domain and power in lowland South America
