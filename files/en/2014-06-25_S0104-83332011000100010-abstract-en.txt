In this paper  starting from the entwinement between gender identity models and the domesticity discourse present in the brazilian popular magazine Casa   Jardim  I discuss the role of representations in the constitution of human subjectivities  Representations influence us as discursive practices by the establishment of norms  standards  and values  which mediate our understanding of the world and guide our conduct within the social milieu  The representations of femininity in Casa   Jardim  disguised as reflections of a supposed feminine  nature  are indeed patterns of subjectivities prescribed by its authors and editors to their women readers
