I will propose a synthesis of my book manuscript in which I explore some metamorphoses of representative democracy as they develop in the domain of opinion  Representative democracy is a diarchic system composed of two pillars  the  will  and  opinion  in today s constitutional democracies the challenges come not so much from the former pillar  the rules of the game  but from the last  the informal power of political judgment  Today the issue of freedom of expression and formation of political opinions seems to be how the public forum of ideas can succeed in remaining a public good and play its monitoring  cognitive  and dissenting role if video power effects politics so radically and if information industry in many different parts of the word belongs to a relative small number of private individuals  Within this scenario which belongs to all consolidated democracies  I will analyze one disfiguration of democratic politics in particular  what I call audience plebiscitarianism
