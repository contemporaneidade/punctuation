This paper analyzes the significance of Nazism  one of the central themes in the latest book by Norbert Elias  It refers to the reasons behind the perplexity of the liberal and Marxist currents in dealing with the phenomenon  at least initially  Beginning with this observation  the author presents Elias  point of view  which strays from a kind of progress history towards an increasingly perfected civilizatory process  It seeks to demonstrate how Elias  interpretation is founded on a long range analysis of German history  highlighting the constitution of habitus as an original explicatory concept  not to be confused with that of national character  The essay also discusses the secondary  albeit relevant  weight Elias ascribes to the context of the 1920s and early 1930s in implanting Nazism  Finally  the author asks whether in Elias  view Nazism was a dated  specific phenomenon and   depending on the answer   what the possibilities might be for its reemergence in the current context
