This article has as its objective to put forward some hypotheses about the dialectical relationships between two social processes  On the one hand  the nation building process in Brazil and on the another hand the transformation of the South American indigenous social organizations  Our starting point is a specific ethnographic background  the Chaco Pantanal  floodable swamps in central Brazil  We make a critique of some evolutionist and structuralist views on state building and indigenous peoples leadership  demonstrating how the segmentary organization and the reciprocity logic are interwoven into colonial social historical dialectics
