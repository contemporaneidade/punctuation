With the establishment of the modern Italian nation after the mid nineteenth century  a constant appeal to the reconstruction of a national intellectual tradition became typical of the Peninsula s political thinking   The latter was part of the challenges of building a new political and social order that guided among other things  a return to the history of the Renaissance and to the figure of Niccol  Machiavelli  Italian Risorgimento would gain new thrust and come to an apex with the papacy s defeat and the construction of a new nation between 1861 and 1871  Along that decade   a time of triumph for unification  a definite return of Machiavelli to Italian culture was prepared  The reinvigoration of historiography and political science in Italy was  therefore  a sort of reencounter with Machiavellian tradition  The Risorgimento was also Machiavelli s rebirth  This essay seeks to examine three moments of this return  which were at the same time attempts to settle accounts with Italian history dating back to the sixteenth century  crystallized in the works of Francesco De Sanctis  1817 1883  Benedetto Croce  1866 1952  and Antonio Gramsci  1891 1937
