This paper aims to discuss the impacts of the globalization process on Brazilian metropolises based on a comparative analysis of the recent trajectory of S o Paulo and Salvador  which provides rich information for this discussion  Starting from the current literature on this topic  the paper analyzes the extent to which the phenomena associated with this process are leading to greater changes in the social and urban structures of these agglomerations  It is noted  with this analysis  that they present some stability next to some changes  whose diversity and complexity are not being addressed by the most current theoretical formulations
