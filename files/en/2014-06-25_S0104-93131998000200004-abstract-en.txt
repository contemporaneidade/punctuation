In various non Indo European languages  grammatical categories such as name  verb and number are classified according to the physical properties or characteristics of their referents  Presenting material on the Tapirap  language  Tupi Guarani family  Brazil  this paper focuses on a linguistic classification which expresses formal properties  flat   round   tall  in alliance with the position of the referred object  lying   seated   standing  within a system subject to combinatory restrictions  Comparison with classificatory systems of other South American Indian languages reveals that despite apparent diversity  it is possible to detect not only a reduced number of geometric semantic components which are always at work  but also coincidences in the inclusion or exclusion of members in the different classes  Diversity can thus be seen as a surface phenomenon  closer examination appears to contradict both moderate and extreme versions of linguistic relativism or  in other words  of the alleged possibility of infinite shapings of an outside world  The Tapirap  case reveals that at stake is not the expression of a culturally filtered pre existing world  rather  it is the case of a reality built out of a very simple but highly profitable semantic geometry in which time  space and aspect are interdependent and by which the speaker s perspective of an event  a fact or the mere recognition of the existence of objects and beings  is apprehended
