Nowadays  the veil of the Muslim women   either real or metaphoric   make part of clearly and sounding political rhetorics at different levels  It is my intention to remind that gendered relationships between Anthropology  Islam and international and national politics have largely supplied the production of this speech making  concurring  thus  for its political thickness  This is why these relations must always stay under scrutiny regardless of the scale of our ethnographies  reminding us that the first step to  unveil  Muslim women is to allow political immunity to anthropological inquiry
