This research seeks to examine and understand the unequal incidence of homicides within the urban perimeters of the city of Cascavel  Paran    between the years 2000 and 2006  We have attempted to understand why this type of crime varies from one administrative unit to another and what relationship exists between this phenomenon and socio economic  infrastructural and urban service inequalities  We begin with a discussion of processes of disorganized urbanization in Brazil  as they have favored the emergence or intensification of several types of problems  including violent crime and homicide  Cascavel is a city with high homicide rates  concentrated within just a few administrative units  In this context and based on the explanations that are postulated in the literature of reference  we have carried out research on the unequal incidence of homicides within this municipality and its association with indicators of inequality  We have used the Exploratory Analysis of Spatial Data as our technique for statistical analysis  We have been able to confirm that the phenomenon we are studying is strongly associated with inequalities in urban space  Thus  we can assert that scenarios of  juxtaposition of needs  and the consequent poor quality of life among the resident population favor occurrence of violent crimes resulting in death
