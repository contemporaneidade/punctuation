This article brings some reflections about the presence of Brazilian enterprises in the African market  focusing particularly the vision of different authors that had studied the trade relationship between Brazil and Africa  The text aims to answer two main questions  Firstly  under what motivations the Brazil Africa trade obtained a notable growth between the 70 s and the 90 s  Secondly  what are the perspectives to the Brazilian entrepreneurs that want to begin a new business in Africa  Through bibliographical research and interviews with businessmen that worked in Africa in the mentioned period and with foreign trade specialists  it was found that in the mentioned years the Brazilian government gave generous incentives to the entrepreneurship directed to the African market  With the end of this privileging policy  many firms failed  nevertheless some of them are still active  for instance the Afro Brazilian Chamber of Commerce and the construction company Norberto Odebrecht  whose trajectories propitiated the entry of other Brazilian enterprises in the African market  Besides that  they propitiate important lessons to the entrepreneurs that wish to initiate a business in the African market  We conclude that  in spite of the reduction of the state support and the changes in the Brazilian internal and external economic context  the commercial opportunities in the African continent exist and can not be ignored by the businessmen  that tend to judge Africa as a whole by its negative aspects  which are stressed by the media  in the same way that many African businessmen are unaware of the quality of the Brazilian products and services
