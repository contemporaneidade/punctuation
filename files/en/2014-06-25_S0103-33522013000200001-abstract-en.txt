This article examines the editorial strategy employed by the newspaper O Globo in dealing with race based affirmative action policies  from the texts published by the newspaper on the topic from 2001 to 2008  We give special attention to opinion pieces  in order to test the hypothesis that O Globo exerts strict editorial control in order to present affirmative action as a public controversy  We called the newspaper s strategy  management of the space for debate  Time based data analysis reveals that  1  O Globo keeps a constant ratio between the number of opinion pieces and the number of news pieces published  and  2  the editors also keep a constant ratio between the number of opinion pieces against race based affirmative action and the ones for it  with a clear advantage for the former  Our study also shows that while editorials and readers  letters are predominantly against the policy  texts authored by academics and columnists are fairly split between pro and con positions  and the ones written by militants  politicians and bureaucrats are chiefly favorable to affirmative action  In sum  our study shows that O Globo is able to put on a fa ade of impartiality while exerting a strict management of the space for debate in ways that allow for opinions against race based affirmative action to have an upper hand
