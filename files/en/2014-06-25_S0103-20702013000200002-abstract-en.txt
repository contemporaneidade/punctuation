The aim of this article is to lend plausibility to the sociological concept of space as a relational disposition of beings and goods  Since globalization processes also interfere in people s ways of experiencing space  Sociology has been forced to rethink its conceptualizations  In methodological terms  I juxtapose two contrary positions  materialist theorems that set out from spatial structure  and practice oriented approaches that set out from action  Citing Anthony Giddens s theory of structuration  I conclude by proposing a synthesis of these two approaches  This allows us to develop a theory of space that neither attributes it with essentialist forces  nor reduces it to a mere sequence of actions
