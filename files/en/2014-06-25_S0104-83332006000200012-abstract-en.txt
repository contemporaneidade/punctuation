The growth of scientific production has stimulated studies which analyse the processes of production  diffusion and use of scientific knowledge  Unfortunately  this literature has not been alert to gender issues  it has neglected the fact that men and women have different trajectories  and that to unveil women in the scientific and technological world demands a specific effort  The hypothesis of scientific neutrality effectively equates the unequals regarding access to scientific and technological careers  The present study aims to fill this gap and to analyse  through an activity indicator  the intensity of scientific activity of men and women in Brazil  and  through a collaboration indicator  the existing co operation between genders in national scientific production
