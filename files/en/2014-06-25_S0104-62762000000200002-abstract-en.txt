This article shows some evidences that the ideological content of the new right agenda is spread out amongst the public of the city of S o Paulo  Such a particular phenomenon is further associated with a broader disposition  that is  the renewal of the right since the mid 1970s in advanced capitalist societies  and in Brazil at large since the late 1980s  The electoral success of the right seems to be associated to its capacity to renew itself and to present its own interests as though social demands  This hypothesis was tested in surveys conducted in the city of S o Paulo in 1993 and 1995  The results of the first investigation indicate that the agenda of the more programmatic right is associated with the richer sectors of the society which  in general  support the neoliberal programme whilst being also anti leftists  Amongst the poorer sectors however  there is more sensitivity towards topics related to morality and authoritarism  as well as statism
