This work examines the intellectual movement that dominated the scientific thought in the social sciences from the 1960s onwards  and its connection with the changes in the world s economic and political relations since then  emphasizing the United States  Two of the most significant manifestations of this movement are found in questions related to the identification of an institutional crisis in American democracy and the need for a process to re evaluate the role of sociology  both from the institutional point of view  and as a tool to explain the social reality of the country and the world  The reorganization of America s economic power  as a result of the technological development and the globalization process  provides the background for the political crisis in the United States  When it becomes evident that the foundations of the American democracy are threatened by changes in its internal structure and behavior  it is possible to detect the development of a considerable amount of research and studies dealing with different perspectives of the large corporations  activities  As a counterpoint to the apparent deterioration of the internal political community  this effort intends to identify the commitments of the business circuit with the civic behavior and democracy  whether in the assertion of ethics in business  or in the perspective of the development of a social policy more compatible with the corporate strategies  It is in this context that the concept of social capital becomes the main articulator of political and theoretical disputes on the subject of the economic development and the changes verified in the industrial sector resulting from the expansion of new technologies and their effects regarding the need for a redimensioning of the intellectual property right
