By maintaining that it is not up to the anthropologist to disempower native discourses  whatever their propositions may be  this work aims to take into account differing statements about processes of religious conversion  Distinct conversion phenomena are not mobilized to be explained by the templates presented  but to evince what are the pressupositions and the applicability of these templates  In this way  and by supporting itself with ethnographic examples  it aims to reposition certain questions about what would be properly called a conversion and how it might take place  Lastly  it analyses how the movements of conversion contemplated implicate a challenge to the notions of acculturation or social change
