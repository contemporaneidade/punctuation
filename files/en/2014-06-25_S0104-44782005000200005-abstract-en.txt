The purpose of the present paper is to analyze the French sociologist Alain Touraine s diverse analytical and theoretical contributions on the social  cultural and political realities of Latin America  Starting from the idea that the author s main concerns refer to the dynamics of Latin American modernity  we seek to understand how this theme is complemented with observations on democracy and the social subject  We are interested in showing that for Touraine  Latin American modernity is characterized by an inevitable tension  between an  instrumental universe  and a  symbolic universe  correlate of a ever present dual image of rationalization and subjectivation  From here  Touraine moves on to analyze the political and social potential that underlies the idea of subject and social actor  Finally  we emphasize the contributions that can be perceived in his concrete analyses of social movements that today make up part of the heterogeneous Latin American scene  the neo Zapatista movement in Chiapas  Mexico  the landless peasant and rural workers movement  and in a more generic sense  urban movements  ecology  Black  youth  women s and intercultural education movements
