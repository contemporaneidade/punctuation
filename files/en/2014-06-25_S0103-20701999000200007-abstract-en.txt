The misunderstandings between the government  on one side  and the MST  the Church and the opposition parties on the other side  when the topic is the agrarian reform  can only be understood if we keep in mind what this agrarian matter is in Brazil  In a country which the big capital turned to be the owner of the lands  the classical conception of the agrarian matter  and of the reforms required by it  is substantially altered  These reforms are what really propose the new conditions and limits to the reform in the country  Moreover  they also point to a possible development of the History of Brazil based in this structural reference  The agrarian reform turned to be a cyclical reform due to the continuous entry and reentry of potential clients in this scene  The fact that the MST and the landless have assumed the initiative of the occupations  being the government only a proxy for the reform  does not indicate the debility of the democratic State in doing the reform  It only indicates that the civil society  through some organization and popular movement  started to have a new role in the structure of the Brazilian State
