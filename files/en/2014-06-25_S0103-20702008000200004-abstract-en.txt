The text examines the complex relations between elements of modern culture of rights  the political proposals of contemporary feminists and the ideals and values of Catholicism  In the first part  the article analyzes the contribution of the Catholic Church in Brazil in constructing a certain  rights culture  during the 1960s  70s and 80s  through the so called  Base Ecclesiastical Communities    the CEBs  At the theoretical level  I explore the interminable conflict between the Catholic Church and the modern values that have formed the base of women s demands since the 18th century  Finally  returning to the sociohistorical reality of the women s movement  I approach the question of extending the concept of rights to include the recently emergent  sexual and reproductive rights  as a new  ma non troppo  field of conflict between feminist and Catholic ideas
