Based on literature mapping out what anthropological research has recorded about abortion in different societies  Luc Boltanski establishes a set of unchanging characteristics  There is no human society unaware of the possibility of voluntarily interrupting pregnancy  Although it is the target of general condemnation  the practice is tolerated  being identified as something on which to  turn a blind eye  Particularly  abortion suffers from a representational  deficit  It rarely appears in narratives or images   differently from  for instance  birth  death or even suicide  Furthermore  abortion is not associated to any form of ritual or symbolism  Such trait is essential for the author to explain his stance on the process of engendering new unique human beings  which is both a biological and s symbolic process
