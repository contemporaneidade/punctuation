Ayahuasca is a psychoactive drink used by many Indigenous groups throughout Amazonia  as well as by mestizo shamans  known as  vegetalistas  religions and independent groups in Brazil  Since the 1990 s the drink has been used to treat dependency  At present  there are a few centres in South America that carry out this type of treatment  I carried out fieldwork in four of them  one in Peru and three in Brazil  In this article I present a short ethnographic description of these centres and offer some considerations about the role of experience during the effects of the tea in the process of recovery from dependency  I also consider the possibility that this type of treatment is not merely a substitution therapy
