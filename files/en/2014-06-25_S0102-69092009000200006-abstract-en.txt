Based on semi structured interviews and direct observation  this paper discusses the stress filled pursuit of safety by motorcycle couriers  motoboys  in Salvador  Brazil  A lack of capable guardianship forces these workers to take multi faceted defensive social action against predatory crime to protect their vehicles  consignments  and personal belongings  The ecological  dis advantages of urban spaces structure are  in turn  structured by this defensive action  Restrictive socio spatial tactics based on individual guardianship capabilities are compared and contrasted with expansive socio spatial tactics involving the negotiation of guardianship resources with others  The conclusion is that  although restrictive and expansive tactics are complementary  the former are more effective means of reducing the ecological disadvantages affecting motoboys than the latter
