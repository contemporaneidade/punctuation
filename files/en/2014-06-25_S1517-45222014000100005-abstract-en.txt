The paper presents a general framework that accounts for the emergence  assessment and management of risk issues  This framework stresses the contended and political nature of the process  and it focuses on the notion of uncertainty as a key characteristic of any risk issue  The paper also puts these processes into the wider context of social and state transformations  in order to suggest that they can only be understood as  1  a means of politicizing new forms of vulnerability by calling unto the state for more protection and security  2  a means of transforming governing practices  through a recourse to science based approaches and depoliticized policy instruments
