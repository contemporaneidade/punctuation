This article deals with the relationship between  organized crime  and  common crime  in Rio de Janeiro  Our goal is to define the conditions that would make it possible to respond to questions such as the extent to which organized crime explains the logic of common crime or whether we are under or overestimating the relation between the two  Our analysis looks at three spheres of violent organized criminal activity   i  organized crime linked to the unofficial lottery called  jogo do bicho   ii  the  commandoes  that control and fight over territories where drugs and other illegal merchandise are retailed and iii  the militias that fight with  commandoes  over the control of these territories  as they seek to impose payment of protection money on inhabitants  We conclude by arguing that the militia model   similarly to what happened earlier in the cases of the drug trade and the  jogo do bicho    all three of which originate in the city of Rio de Janeiro    has been spreading to cities in other Brazilian states  nationalizing forms of organized crime that have the use of violence as one of their major characteristics  The dynamics of these organizations depends primarily on their constitution as illegal markets  in which each commodity that is exploited   lottery  drugs  arms and protection   has different properties as forms of capital  The social dynamic  type of actions and violence associated with each one of the three is  in turn  linked to these properties
