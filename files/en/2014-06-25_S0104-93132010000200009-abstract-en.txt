In recent years  some American scholars have become embroiled in an extensive debate on  anthropology and espionage  The accusations levelled at some colleagues have been prompted by concerns over the potential use of knowledge generated during fieldwork  These accusations have shown that anthropologists can be regarded as  dangerous  to the populations under study  Echoing the same kinds of concern  sometimes anthropologists are accused by  their  natives themselves  In this article I discuss two episodes that occurred during my own fieldwork among a group of relatives of victims of a fire in Buenos Aires  On two different occasions during my fieldwork I was publicly accused of being an infiltrado  or inside agent  sent to spy on their actions and conversations  My aim here is to transform these apparently personal and anecdotal episodes into research questions capable of providing an insight into the perspectives of those accusing me  Inspired by other anthropological studies of witchcraft accusations  I look to analyze the dynamics of the social field in which the accusations were produced  simultaneously resituating my own role as a producer of knowledge
