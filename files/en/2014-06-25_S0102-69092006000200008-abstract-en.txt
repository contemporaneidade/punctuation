This article deals with a particular kind of work organization  the so called  production cells  model  and discuss the macrosocial context where they have grown in the industry sector  It presents the results of a fieldwork carried out within two plants in clothing manufacturing branches in the surroundings of S o Paulo City  Its main purpose is to reinterpret some judgments concerning multi tasking  skills and flexibility due to the administrative and management rationale in contrast to the ones coming from the sewing workers themselves  The cherishing point of the model   the self regulation by the group   is at the same time the moment where the less productive member is expelled from the cell group  That contradictory crossing of opposite strains is highlighted by the paper so as to emphasize the problematic quest for solidarity in terms of social class s scheme  The erosion of classical institutions for collective action   especially the ones related to capital and labor conflict   is assumed to grow in the tracks of that new model of work organization  to which we have to add also other aspects  such as the payment system  training and qualification requirements  In the end  the article points out that the individualization mood issued from production cells is hardly compatible with the typical stressing on  social question  raised by the modern times
