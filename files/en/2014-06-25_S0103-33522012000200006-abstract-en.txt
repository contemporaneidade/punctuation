A critical void in the research on women s underrepresentation in elective office is an analysis of the initial decision to run for office  Based on data from our Citizen Political Ambition Study  the first large scale national survey of potential candidates  we examine the process by which women and men emerge as candidates for public office  We find that women who share the same personal characteristics and professional credentials as men express significantly lower levels of political ambition to hold elective office  Two factors explain this gender gap  first  women are far less likely than men to be encouraged to run for office  second  women are significantly less likely than men to view themselves as qualified to run  Our findings call into question the leading theoretical explanations for women s numeric underrepresentation and indicate that  because of vestiges of traditional sex role socialization  prospects for gender parity in U S  political institutions are less promising than conventional explanations suggest
