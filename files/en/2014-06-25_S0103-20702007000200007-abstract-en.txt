In the Garden of Flowers  a peripheral district of a city of the interior of S o Paulo  people interpret their world  among other ways  by telling stories about heaven and earth  and the destruction and recreation of the world  How should one interpret these interpretations  As a way for dealing with this question  Geertz developed the notion of  thick description  by which one may distinguish a twitch from a wink  The stories told in the Garden of Flowers are not mere interpretations  however  They emerge from the will to interrupt the very course of the world  As they say something about the world  they also erupt as provocations  with awakening effects  causing one s eyes to close and reopen  By means of tension filled images   thick description  may also acquire the qualities of tense description  provoking astonishment  Perhaps ellipses  incoherencies  and suspicious emendations   where a text seems to come apart   are signs of the  lower bodily stratum  of the text we call culture  As stories of the Garden of Flowers reveal  it is in these places that one may find the more fertile layers of a text  or  still  its eschatological soil
