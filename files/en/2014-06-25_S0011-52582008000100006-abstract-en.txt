This article discusses how ethnic conflicts negatively affect human rights and how international intervention acts for the defense of these rights  We thus compare the structure by which ethnic conflicts are triggered and an ideal scenario in which the state is capable of guaranteeing human rights  in keeping with the United Nations perspective  While identifying the points at which ethnic conflicts breach the foundations of human rights  we analyze a second scenario in which it is impossible to guarantee such rights  raising the issue of humanitarian intervention  Finally  we argue that although human rights have gained relevance in the post Cold War period  they do not constitute a cohesive set of objectives  Therefore  in order to understand the selectiveness behind humanitarian interventions  we conclude that it is essential to consider other interests
