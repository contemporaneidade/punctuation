The article presents an analysis of the political and institutional setting that explain the production of coherent and stable economic reforms in societies undergoing the simultaneous transformations of politics and property  On the basis of a comparative study of the German  Hungarian and Czech cases  the authors sustain that contrary to conventional wisdom  political and institutional situations that constrain the autonomy of the executive tend to produce more coherent and stable reforms  In contrast  historical situations in which the executive is freed from constraints  produce less coherent and more unstable policies  The authors also introduce the concept of extended accountability to elaborate a theoretical and conceptual framework to understand the institutional sources of sustainable policies of economic transformations
