The megalopolis of Mexico City exists as a social and physical space  as a demographic ordering and disorder  but also in the forms imagined every day by the press  radio and television  These media organize the invisible communities of their public  which are informed through the media about the city  and they sometimes participate with reader s letters or in phone in programs  How is the public sphere reconstituted in these communicational circuits  Do the media contribute to the transparency and democratization of the city  or do they simply reproduce urban common sense
