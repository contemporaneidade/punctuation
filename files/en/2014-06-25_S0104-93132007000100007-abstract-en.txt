Based on both ethnographic and bibliographic research  the present article examines the subject of fat in gymnastic academies  focusing on issues relating to the body and the person  An analysis of body evaluation evinces the terms of a scientific production that configures the body as a metabolism subject to risk and malleability  What is at stake are body contents  where the aesthetic ideal is not thinness  but the  toning  of the body  the result of replacing fat with muscle mass  The search for beauty involves constant management of the risk inherent in balancing these components  Beauty and health are forms of self care   an imperative central to contemporary individualism   through the management of body contents  Thus  body evaluation delineates internal elements and aspects of intimacy  and endows bodily practices with the capacity to stimulate an interaction between them
