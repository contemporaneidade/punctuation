Tired or excluded  This text maps the profile of the politicians who most frequently tend to give up the race for office  It is based on research covering legislative elections between 1990 and 2006  observing the profile of representatives and senators who refused to be considered the  natural candidates  and opted not to run for re election nor go for higher level offices  Politicians who ran for offices that are considered to be of lesser prestige than the ones originally occupied are also included in our analysis  in order to look at unsuccessful trajectories and compare them with cases in which a mandate has been given up completely  This group of members of parliament could  at a first glance  seem to constitute the exception to the well known formula that politicians become increasingly ambitious  In general terms  we note that the politicians who step back from electoral struggle   whether permanently or maintaining some strategies to continue   belong to groups that 1  have in some way exhausted their participation and influence in political competition  for example  they may have been exposed through scandal  gotten old or belong to decadent social groups  or 2  have not yet managed to enter the political field with the same ease as their peers  as in the case of women  those who debut in a first mandate  substitutes or members of parliament who represent minority factions
