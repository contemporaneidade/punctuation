This text has the specific character of debate retaken by the author caused by reviews and interviews about his book The Idea of Latin America  published in 2005  It begins demonstrating how the various narratives of the history of colonization are plural  but as they spread they become unified in global narratives of an universal character  as an effect of totality processes  For the author that diversity of silent but alive historical forces  are today exposed  without a perspective of return to the past  In this sense he speaks about the modernity coloniality project of decolonizing knowledge  answering and deepening several paradoxical aspects forwarded by the debate of his book  as the dialogue among thoughts of emancipation and movements that appear in the center of the world system  With this he doesn t intend to close the debate  but  on the contrary  strives to update it and to move forward in those issues of non homogeneous populations and difference from a perspective of future and from a perspective of a pluri versalist knowledge and practices
