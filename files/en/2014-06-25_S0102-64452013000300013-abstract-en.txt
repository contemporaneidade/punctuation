This article aims at discussing the contributions of G  H  Mead s pragmatism for two turns within critical theory  If the first generation of Frankfurt was averse to the American pragmatists  they became central to subsequent generations of critical theorists  Mead s writings is one of the bases of the Habermasian theory of communicative action  It is also at the core of Honneth s notion of recognition  The objective of this article is to reconstruct the reinterpretations of Mead s work developed by these two philosophers  in order to reveal two alternative democratic projects to critical theory from the same pragmatist grounds  In doing this  the article seeks to evince Mead s relevance for contemporary political theory
