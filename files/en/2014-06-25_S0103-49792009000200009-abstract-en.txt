This paper consists of an analysis of the business social responsibility  RSE in Portuguese  as a means of suppression of politics as a sphere of dissent manifestation  The performance of organizations such as Group of Institutes  Foundations and Companies  in Portuguese  GIFE  and of the Instituto Ethos de Empresas e Responsabilidade Social  Ethos Institute of Companies and Social Responsability  has been contributing significantly to the legitimation of RSE actions as sources of solutions for social problems  In this sense  we understand that the ideological foundation of that situation lies in the discourse that seeks to minimize the role of the State as promoting agent of social development and to attribute to the poor  as individuals  the responsibility for their permanence in or out poverty  For no other reason  such practices promote the beneficiaries  involvement in the solutions of their problems  what seems to be positive from the point of view of creation of a sphere of more democratic decision making  However  it is necessary to have in mind that these beneficiaries  knowledges are only considered if emptied of effectively dissentious postures
