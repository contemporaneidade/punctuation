Muslim women encounter three fronts simultaneously  First  they represent an Islamic identity that more often than not is in conflict with modern political regimes and state elites  Secondly  they must fight against Islamic fundamentalists  whose ideas  institutions  and goals they vehemently reject  And finally  and just as importantly  they face a mundane confrontation with a prevailing patriarchal culture within which they live  Questions of women s rights are exacerbated by difficulties Muslim women encounter in a patriarchal culture in which women are often characterized by stereotypes  The  borderless solidarity  has led to the promotion of women s rights across and within cultures  but it stands in a problematic relationship to broader  more complex social issues  Although this global solidarity is resisted in many parts of the Muslim world  women s empowerment is seen as the most effective antidote to extremism in the Muslim world  This paper attempts to contextualize gender analysis in the cultural  economic  and political domains  while addressing three questions   1  why have Muslim women become the agents of change  reform  and democratization in a globalizing world   2  what impact has globalization on Muslim women and the rise of Islamic feminism   3  how could Muslim women maintain the integrity of their culture while at the same time remain receptive to universal values  ideas  and institutions
