It is often argued that Marx s labour theory of value no longer applies in the contemporary world in which increasing proportions of the population are involved in  immaterial  or  digital  labour  This article contends that the theory is still relevant  but that in order to understand how it can be applied both to immaterial labour and to labour more generally  it is necessary to examine critically the three key components of the theory  the particular nature of any given form of labour  the value that is created by that labour  and the worker s means of subsistence  Such an analysis enables us not only to distinguish between  necessary labour time  and surplus value but also to identify the point of production  In a world in which new activities are constantly being brought within the sphere of capitalist social relations and new commodities are being produced  it is important to identify these points of production and the workers who are directly engaged in the production of surplus value because it is these workers who have the potential  by withdrawing their consent  to organise effectively in the common interests of the global working class
