Our aim is to understand the relationships between the base of the Landless Rural Workers Movement  MST  and their leaders  taking the structural organization formally adopted in 2003 as an element for mediation  For this purpose  three analytical keys are used  Clastres  who explores the idea of structure separate from social body  Leach  who opposes  contrasts  an abstract model of organization with the practical situations observed and interpreted from the perspective of the materiality of behavior of the settlers and squatters  Neo institutionalism  which studies how institutions regulate social life through rules and norms  These analyses were based on observations made at the Twelfth MST Meeting in the State of Para ba and at the rural settlements called Jos  Antonio Eufrosino and Osiel Pereira  located in the municipality of Campina Grande  Rejecting approaches that attempt to measure how much the formal organizational models have been adopted by the social groups  we have tried to reveal the productive incongruences of the dynamics of MST s organizational restructuring
