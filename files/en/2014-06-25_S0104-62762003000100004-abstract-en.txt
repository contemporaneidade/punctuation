This article is an inquiry into the political economy of federalism and the basic question explored is  does the overrepresentation of territories  states or provinces  in national legislatures of federal systems affect the territorial distribution of public spending by federal governments  The hypothesis to be tested is that it does  and that territorial overrepresentation produces a distortion of federal spending which benefits the population that live in overrepresented territories  To capture this connection it was introduced a conceptual distinction between territorial overrepresentation and the non proportional distribution of public funds  countries where this connection exists are identified as cases of reallocative federalism  whereas countries with territorial patterns of public spending that are proportional to population are identified as cases of proportional federalism  The evidence is drawn from subnational level data  at the provincial state level  from the Western Hemisphere s four largest federal countries  the United States of America  Brazil  Mexico  and Argentina  benefits populations living in overrepresented territories
