This text is about the deeply underlying causes of the crisis and its manifestations over the past five years  particularly regarding the intense competition  truly a  currency war  Beyond the  chronicle of events  of the crisis its financial and monetary dimensions  a crisis of  sovereign  debts  the Euro s future and its  afterlife  the author seeks out the problematic that has hovered over this crisis since 2008  The guiding principle capable of grasping its process is still the analysis of real process  based on Marx s method and theory  through the evolution of  competitive  capitalism  The importance of competition and also its current tendency for intensification have been revealed  New conditions of capital appreciation and profit seeking have become evident in complex processes of destruction creation of value  and they also illustrate the mechanisms linked to super accumulation of capital to the resulting super production of goods  Marx helps us understand that in order for capitalism to survive  it must keep  extorting  the surplus value  whatever the cost  It is an absolute imperative for it to reproduce  and today this gives it a brutal predatory character in all societal domains
