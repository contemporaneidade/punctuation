This paper is about two related subjects  how to classify political regimes in general  and how Latin American regimes should be classified for the 1945 1999 period  We make five general claims about regime classification  First  regime classification should rest on sound concepts and definitions  Second  it should be based on explicit and sensible coding and aggregation rules  Third  it necessarily involves some subjective judgments  Fourth  the debate about dichotomous versus continuous measures of democracy creates a false dilemma  Neither democratic theory  nor coding requirements  nor the reality underlying democratic practice compel either a dichotomous or a continuous approach in all cases  Fifth  dichotomous measures of democracy fail to capture intermediate regime types  obscuring variation that is essential for studying political regimes  This general discussion provides the grounding for our trichotomous ordinal scale  which codes regimes as democratic  semi democratic or authoritarian in nineteen Latin American countries from 1945 to 1999  Our trichotomous classification achieves greater differentiation than dichotomous classifications and yet avoids the need for massive information that a very fine grained measure would require
