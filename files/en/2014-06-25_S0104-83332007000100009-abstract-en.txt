In this work  I intend to investigate homoerotic practices among men in S o Paulo city in sites for casual  group or anonymous sex  involving sometimes fetishisms and or sadomasochism  Preliminary field data  most of which collected in the Internet  shed light on the existence of discourses that grant great value to masculinity in some of these contexts  My hypothesis is that such valorization must be taken into account so as to fathom out the processes of body materialization and subjectivity construction in each of these men
