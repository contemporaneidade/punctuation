In this article we analyze decision making processes within the Municipal Health Council  Conselho Municipal de Sa de de Curitiba  or CMSC  in the city of Curitiba  focusing on the distribution of political influence among its different segments  After exploring the analytical model founded on resource holding  we conclude that the distribution of political influence within the CMSC cannot be exclusively attributed to the differential possession of conventional resources  Thus  we propose a broader version of the model  including non conventional resources  Furthermore  we suggest that the factors that make up the context in which the councils are situated contribute to the formation of different patterns of action and interaction and thereby help to explain why resources do not always translate immediately into political influence
