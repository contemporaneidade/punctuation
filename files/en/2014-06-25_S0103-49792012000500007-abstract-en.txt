The New Rhetoric  A Treatise on Argumentation  published in 1958  is usually associated by argumentation scholars with the rhetoric of thinkers ranging from Corax and Thysias to Aristotle and Quintilian  This type of association reveals the doubtful tendency to take Perelmann s theory as a reconstruction of Aristotelian rhetoric  It is worth noticing that these have actually distinct fields of application  In face of the narrow bound between rhetoric an eloquence  which draws the characteristic features of ancient rhetoric  one must reckon that the new rhetoric incorporates elements of argumentative elaboration   and thus of the textual product   which were not then contemplated in the rhetorical field  Even the New Rhetoric no longer stands as reference to those wishing to be initiated in the hard task of analyzing argumentative pieces  Also the New Rhetoric  engraved in socio juridical theories of Boaventura Sousa Santos  does not contemplate the present time cognitive environment and models  Today  persuasion strategies have assumed features which are so differentiated that they hardly resemble those pointed out in classics dedicated to describe them  such as Aristotle and Schopenhauer  Our approach consists in contemplating the pragmatic component of argumentation   persuasion   so as to configure the existence of a Nuper rhetoric capable of contemplating the  mainly  persuasive environment s  and the elaboration of argumentative pieces
