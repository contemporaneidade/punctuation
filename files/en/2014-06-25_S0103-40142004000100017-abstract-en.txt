THIS ARTICLE outlines the trajectory of blacks in Brazilian literature  both as an object  with a distant perspective  and as a subject  with a more assertive attitude  As result it addresses the literary text on blacks  on the one hand  and by Blacks  on the other  It identifies a long history of stereotypes  associated with a prejudice vision of Blacks  both explicitly and implicitly  It seeks to describe the moment of passage in wich the stereotype was overtaken by the affirmation of blacks as subjects of their discourse  acting in defense of own cultural worth and identity  It selects a number of representative authors and texts starting in the 1970s  a particularly vital moment of Black conciousness affirmation in Brazil  It then argues the propriety of styling ablack literature  superficially presented as a positive affirmation  but pregnant of being turned into a form of implicit prejudice
