The article presents the discourse that gave rise to the concept of subjective right  fundamental to the birth of the ideal of human rights  The first part is a description of the concept of justice existent in the scholastic field and then looks at the emergence of the notion of subjective right in the last phase   the nominalistic phase   of this school of thought  Finally  the article considers the appropriation by the Second Scholastic of this notion within a holistic conception of justice  The argument is centred  therefore  on the relationship between justice and the right to individual freedom
