This text is aimed at outlining the meaning that the relationship between society and scientific knowledge has taken under the context of capitalism  Capitalist development and modern science advanced from a relationship of interdependence between mercantile logic of the former and the linear assumptions of the latter  Therefore  several unwanted consequences produced by the system in the last centuries can be credited to Cartesian rationalism  In the meanwhile  in face of unfulfilled promises of capitalism in its cognitive version  modern science starts to be challenged in its most basic fundament  man s domination over nature  Nonlinear perspectives emerge or re emerge from its criticism  which seek to consider new connections and or knowledges between consciousness and existence  between subject and object  between man and nature  between society and knowledge  Our expectation is that such debate  marked by antagonism and tensions  more transparent as it is more impertinent  can contribute to a dialogue that ends in knowledge that is less obtuse for attending to reality s complexity  A new knowledge able to humbly reconcile with the necessary and urgent wisdom that will allow man to make other and new choices   to be born again
