The article examines the panorama currently facing the Brazilian university  In the postmodern era  the process that has transformed knowledge and nature into wealth has brought with it the hypertrophy of mass culture and the spread of telecommunications and computer technology  These latter phenomena act as vectors that have shifted the university away from the central position it held in the nineteenth century  The atrophy of the State and hypertrophy of audiovisual language have reduced the institution s significance and visibility  In Brazil  these vectors have all been reinforced by a choice to enter the globalization process in passive fashion  This explicit relinquishing of an affirmation of the nation has reduced the university s space  The article ends by examining current issues in institutional definition  where any eventual format will be vital to the future of the Brazilian university
