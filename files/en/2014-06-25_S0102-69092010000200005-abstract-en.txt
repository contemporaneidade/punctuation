This paper analyzes the determinants of social mobility for men and women in Brazil in 1982 and 1996  based on status attainment regressions and multinomial conditional logistic models  We are especially interested in the way social origins  race  and education shape inequalities of opportunities  The main result is that education is the one truly important variable  although its returns are rapidly diminishing  which accounts for almost all of the increase in social fluidity during this period  Race and social origins may play a large role in determining educational attainment  but  once in the labor market  they are of less importance  No relevant interactions were detected  which entails that returns to education do not vary by race  The patterns of social mobility are very similar for both men and women
