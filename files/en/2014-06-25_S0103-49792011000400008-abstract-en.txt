This paper examines the teaching work in public universities  especially at the Federal University of Bahia in Portuguese  UFBA  between 2005 and 2008  from the phenomenon of the precarization of labor and the consequent alienation of the worker  based on the results of doctoral research in UFBA  It describes the fundamental dimensions of this process  the multiplicity of tasks    internal and external fundraising for research  contradictions between training and the demands of the university system  work overload and its consequences  such as absence of leisure  loss of control over the academic project and illness  It concludes that the main contradiction experienced by the teachers is that the autonomy perceived by them is not the one exercised  since it is subjected to various internal and external controls of the meritocratic system  whose demands exceed the physical and psychic capacity of the teacher to respond appropriately   However  understanding the process of alienation is the basis for transformation and emancipation of those who have a fundamental role in developing the capacities of others
