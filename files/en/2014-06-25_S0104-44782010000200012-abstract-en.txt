This article seeks to analyze the relational pattern that the Lula government has maintained with movements and organizations of civil society  OSCs  in the period spanning 2003 to 2006  Its goal is to inquire as to whether and what kind of opportunities were created for the establishment of a  positive synergy  between State and civil society during this period  We start from the hypothesis that the creation of new participatory spaces  although an important condition to guarantee a truly inclusive dynamic  is in and of itself insufficient  Our analysis shows that notwithstanding the fact that the Lula government created a new pact with organized civil society through the creation  widening and institutionalization of new participatory spaces  this practice did not become a government policy that rallied majority support  Thus  the efforts that have been carried out for constructing and perfecting the participation of civil society organizations in Lula administration public policies have become marginal and selective  and thus undermine the inclusive potential that they themselves could be generating
