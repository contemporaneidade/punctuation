This article aims to analyze the form in which the Italian migrants who arrived in the central region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul at the end of the 19th century colonized the region and the social categories used in the process  As a source  I make use of memoirs written by two immigrants  Julio Lorenzoni  published in 1975  and Andrea Pozzobon  published in 1997  as well as the Album celebrating the First Fifty Years of Italian Immigration in the state  written in Italian and printed in 1925  An anthropological analysis of the written narratives documenting this immigration has also proven to be extremely fertile in terms of understanding the contemporary dynamic of ethnic claims at local level  based on the construction of an origin rooted in Italian ancestry
