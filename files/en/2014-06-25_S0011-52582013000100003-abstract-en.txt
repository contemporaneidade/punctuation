The analysis of the relationship between race and democracy in Brazil requires a specific theoretical approach based on different conceptions of recognition  This article aims to address critically the theories of Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth in an attempt to deepen the understanding of how a hierarchy of status  which is based on the racial issue and imbricate elements of public  social and private space  was established in Brazil  We point out a number of distinctions in the forms of racial stratification in the United States and Brazil showing that differences can not be reduced to interracial relationships existing in Brazil  We attribute this contrast to the different traditions of legal regulation  We also discussed the different traditions of racial integration and affirmative action in both countries trying to shed light on conceptual lacks of the theories that think racial integration only from the perspective of private sphere  At the end of the paper we propose a recognition model that integrates the theories of Fraser and Honneth and associates the assigning of legal status to racial segments historically subordinate to a policy that deals with the formation of self esteem
