This article examines the development of regional  sul rio grandense  industry and of its labor market in the period between 1920 and 1950  The aim is to consider to what extent the conditions observed in this industry   which in 1920 paid higher wages and operated with higher productivity in relation to S o Paulo s industry   were altered in the following three decades  The conclusion is that  although the regional pattern of industrial development had roughly been preserved  the productivity increase was not sufficient to keep the high relative level of wages  which were also impaired by the increase of the labor supply
