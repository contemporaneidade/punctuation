The book Amazonian Languages  compiled by R  M  W  Dixon and A  Y  Aikhenvald  published in 1999  is already a reference work  shy  indeed  practically compulsory reading for anyone interested in linguistics  the indigenous languages of Amazonia and the ethnology of lowlands South America  Nonetheless  the book contains sections and themes that have provoked strong reactions in the scientific community both inside and outside Brazil  This essay presents not only the book s undoubted contributions towards advancing our knowledge of Amazonian languages  but also the criticisms justifiably levelled at some of its chapters  caused by empirical and theoretical limitations  as well as others concerning the book s introduction and its provocative opinions regarding specific research policies in South America  The introduction to the book opposes categories  national versus foreign linguists  plays verbal sophistry with identities  missionary linguists and linguistic missionaries  and paints a contestable and erroneous picture of what it means to research and study indigenous languages   Amazonian  or otherwise
