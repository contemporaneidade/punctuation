The article notes a return  in social sciences  to the notion of subject likely to lead to a new approach of subjectivity in the field of study of social representations  After an examination of the moments that have signified the death and resurrection of the notion of subject  it develops the different themes characterizing the reintegration of this notion in history  sociology and anthropology  These themes allow to rule out the risk of a solipsist vision in the treatment of the subjective part of social representations  For that purpose  a schema is proposed  relating the genesis and the functions of social representations to three spheres  subjective  inter subjective  trans subjective  and illustrated by an analysis of the debates concerning the famous Mahomet s caricatures affair  The final remarks claim to orient the study of social representations towards the relations between thinking and social change
