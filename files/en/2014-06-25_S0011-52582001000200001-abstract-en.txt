Debates on the organization of modernity articulated by the state  which succeeded 19th century liberal modernity and was immersed in a crisis in the 1970s and 80s  failed to reach a conclusion  Rather than resuming post modernist ideas  this article develops the thesis that we are now in the midst of a third stage of modernity  resulting from that crisis and characterized by more evolutive complexity and mixed articulation  This stage  together with other more contingent and fluid forms of sociability  rests on three principles  market  hierarchy  within corporations and the state  and network  The example of contemporary procedural law is used both as an index of reality and hence to introduce the discussion of those three stages of development in modernity
