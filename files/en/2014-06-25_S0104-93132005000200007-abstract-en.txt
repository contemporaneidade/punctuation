Over the last few years  urban Brazil has seen the merging of new forms of spirituality with alternative therapeutic practices  Different labels have been used to define these experiences  Many anthropological and sociological publications  however  have already classified the phenomenon under the general rubric of New Age cultures  This text aims to reconsider this type of work   and the accompanying spiritual practices   from the therapeutic point of view  as well as examining the procedures used to alleviate and cure illnesses or symptoms  Issues such as the notion of work  ritual space and behaviours  ritual time and therapeutic time  the therapeutic relationship  narrative performances  symbolic mediators  the relation between collective myths and personal narratives are discussed and related to the central meanings of this type of work  The text concludes that each process of treatment involves substituting the object of the cure with the individual as a whole  One of the key meanings to emerge in the present work is the empowermnent of the individual and the emergence of the subject
