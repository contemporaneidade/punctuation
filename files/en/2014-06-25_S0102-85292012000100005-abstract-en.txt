This article aims at understanding the concept of global civil society  from a dialogue between constructivism in International Relations and the French thinker Michel Foucault  Divided in three sections  followed by a conclusion  the text intends to insert itself in an academic space of a profound contestation concerning the philosophical basis of the conventional theories in the social sciences and  specially  in International Relations  The first section is dedicated to the discussion about global civil society as a space of agent structure interaction  the next section treats the concept as a heterogeneous set of non state agents of global scope  The third section fuses the two parts of the definition  This way  two defining dimensions of global civil society are proposed  in the first one  a political space  in the second  a set of agents with specific characteristics  Lastly  a brief conclusion ends the text   but not the polemics involved in the discussion  It s concluded that the contemporary context is marked by a huge complexity  so that it becomes urgent an approach that precludes binary oppositions  and naturalized and reified ontological boundaries  thus being able to interpret in a more adequate way the actual social and political relations
