American tolerance research traditionally discusses the influence of education on political tolerance  These debates are transferred into a German context  and the article aims to complement previous research on tolerance by a combination of value based explanations  of findings about mass belief systems and about heuristics in decision making  It is assumed that the levels of education and political sophistication of a person determine his her attitudes on political tolerance  because they have an impact on the relevance of values and ideological dispositions as abstract principles for individual decisions on tolerance situations  As a result of our empirical analyses  we can emphasize the separate influence of political sophistication and the contextual nature of tolerant attitudes  partly due to individual differences in the handling of abstract principles
