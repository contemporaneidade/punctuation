This paper aims at dealing with religion as both a system and as a communication power and  from another point of view  rebuilding the connections between symbolic religious universes and social environments that change both in time and space  Tracking down descendance lines in order to find irreducible similarities between distinct religious traditions  brought up and established diachronically in either the same or far away socio cultural environments  does not wear out the undertaking of a compared sociology of religions  By such formula we comprehend the search for structural components in the relation between foundation process and construction processes of a religious belief system  between an initial creation experience and the successive systematization of a set of beliefs and ritualistic practices
