The aim of this article is to analyze the current dynamic of the S o Paulo religious field  seen not through the plurality of its religious organizations  nor through the positions adopted by ecclesiastical or group leaders  Instead  I focus on the individual religious agents and their attitudes in response to a growing religious pluralism and diversification  The work therefore looks at individuals who are  religious mutants  people who have changed their religious affiliation at least once during their lives  or who are religious duplicates or multiplicates  participants of two or more symbolic religious universes simultaneously  By studying people s religious trajectories  we can analyze their beliefs and religious practices irrespective of their affiliation to specific organized groups  With the single exception of the Protestants  still anchored in the conception of a transcendent God and a strong ecclesiality  though the Pentecostals diverge slightly through their incorporation of magic  we can perceive a trend towards a kind of religiosity that Troeltsch called mystic   and which Campbell identifies as its orientalization  The followers of other religions  or the duplicates multiplicates  tend towards mystical religious ideas and magical practices lived out in private  accept frequenting a variety of religious groups and repudiate clerical authoritarianism  The old conflicts of traditional religious duplicities  Catholicism Spiritism  Catholicism Afro Brazilian Religions  have been amplified with new forms  Catholic Protestant  Catholic Other Religions  and with the emergence of multiplicity  reproducing in Brazilian style the same transformations experienced throughout the West for a long time
