Based on a case study of an organization responsible for publishing a magazine sold to  homeless  people in Buenos Aires  I examine the social uses of money in philanthropic circles  Turning to the polemic between money and gift at the centre of discussions in anthropology and sociology  I focus on two questions  a  the role of money in demarcating the limits between  market transactions  and  gift circulations  b  the relation between money and morality  Fieldwork involved an ethnographic study of the transactions between the sellers and buyers of this publication
