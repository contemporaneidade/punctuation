This article analyzes participatory policies created by the State from the perspective of  authority  the capacity of these new decision making forums to solve problems  enforce decisions and have an impact on the external world  Based on examples from two types of participatory policy river basin committees and participatory budgets it argues that the construction of authority is more likely to occur when both State and society actors perceive the new decision making process as beneficial to their interests  On the one hand  the article shows how  in successful cases  actors design participatory policy around shared interests  On the other hand  it examines how cognitive factors can both facilitate and make more difficult the identification of such interests  The article argues that technical ideas  such as participatory models  can help actors to perceive the creation of participatory forums as in their interest  However  when models are followed blindly  they can become  cognitive locks  making it more difficult for actors to adapt the ideas to local conditions
