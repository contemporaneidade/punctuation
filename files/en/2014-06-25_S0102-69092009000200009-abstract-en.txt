This paper seeks to discuss the theory of recognition and to defend  as Taylor and Honneth do  a perspective steered by the notion of self realization  Dealing with the propositions of Fraser and Markell  it aims at challenging three major criticisms directed to the so called identity model of recognition  1  the critique that it essentializes identities  2  the critique that it lacks mechanisms for distinguishing warranted claims from unjustifiable demands  and 3  the critique that struggles for recognition would only seek a valorization of social groups  These criticisms are based on a distinct notion of recognition  which reduces it to a cultural struggle for the valorization of identities  The paper argues that an attention to the intersubjective grounds of Taylor s and Honneth s propositions helps to undermine these criticisms
