Brazil s environmental impact assessment system is not yet capable of coping with the challenge presented by the pluri annual plans that have been the means of organizing government priorities since 1996  It is hoped that this challenge results in strengthening of the system  Generic problems with the licensing process include stimulation of a lobby in favor of construction before decisions are made on the advisability of the projects  the  dragging effect  of third parties whereby economic activity is attracted to the infrastructure but escapes the environmental impact assessment system  a tendency for consulting firms to produce favorable reports  a bureaucratic emphasis on the existence of steps such as the submission of reports and the holding of public hearings without regard to the content of what is said  and the inability to take account of the chain of events unleashed when a given project is undertaken  The example of the pluri annual plans from Brazil in Action  1996 1999  up to the current PAC 2  Program for the Acceleration of Growth 2   2012 2015  makes clear the need to rethink how major development decisions are made  and to reconsider a number of the plan s component projects
