Market Sociology has been one of the most vibrant fields in Sociology in the past 25 years  There is a great deal of agreement that markets are social structures characterized by extensive social relationships between firms  workers  suppliers  customers and governments  But  like in many sociological literatures  the theory camps that have formed often seem to speak by each other  We show that some of the disagreement between the theory camps is due to differences in conceptual language  and other disagreements stem from the fact that theory camps ignore the concepts in other theory camps  thereby making their theories less complete  We end by considering deeper controversies in the literature that seem open both to new conceptualization and to further empirical research
