In 1938  W  Benjamin elaborated a model of his major work  the Arcades Project  conceived as a social history of the city of Paris in the 19th century  the model remained unconcluded  but there is an integral plan of its construction  discovered in 1981 at the Biblioth que Nationale of France  Based upon the deciphering of these manuscripts  80  unpublished  this article presents a synthesis of the Arcades Model  in form of a constellation of the 30 colored sigla which symbolize the 30 constructive categories  The working hypothesis is that they are an esoteric script  with specific aesthetic  semantic and structurizing values  a mimetic instrument appropriated to read the enigmatic text of the modern metropolis  Seven aspects of the sigla are presented in this analysis  historiographical workshop  physiognomical scripts  visualization of time  history as cartography  pictures of mentality  allegorization  and history as radiography  As they operate on the boundary of conceptual and pictographical traditions  the sigla constitute a frontier genre in historiography
