The article discusses the autonomy of Brazil s Central Bank and its potential relationship to the national currency s stability  Beyond the government budget balance and the Central Bank s autonomy  we seek to demonstrate that the currency s stability also depends on the Bank s own political and institutional stability  Due to a gap in the literature  which has focused little attention on the political conditions and economic motivation by which important steps were taken towards achieving autonomy  we analyze the relations between autonomy and stability from a historical institutional perspective  We call attention to the cyclical nature of the Brazilian economy  which alternates developmentalist policies and stabilization policies and thereby alters the Central Bank s role and degree of autonomy
