This paper examines two differences between the party systems of the advanced industrial democracies and party systems of less developed countries  particularly in terms of the level of institutionalization  The overarching argument is that the party systems of less developed countries are less institutionalized  More specifically  we first show that most democracies and semi democracies in less developed countries have much higher electoral volatility and less electoral stability than the advanced industrial democracies  Second  much of the literature on parties and party systems assumes the context of institutionalized party systems with strong party roots in society and further presupposes that programmatic or ideological linkages are at the root of the stable linkages between voters and parties  In the party systems of most democracies and semi democracies in less developed countries  programmatic or ideological linkages between voters and parties are weaker  In this direction also  linkages between voters and candidates are more personalistic in democracies and semi democracies of less developed countries than in the advanced industrial democracies
