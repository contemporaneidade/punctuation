Our objective is to examine Gramsci 39 s reflections on the  riviste tipo  focusing both on his editorial activity  according to a project and division of labor that were rationally planned  and his activity in cultural circles  disseminating views on the world and contributing to cultural organization  For Gramsci  activity around  riviste tipo  could serve as a parameter for educational work geared toward raising the cultural level of subaltern classes  In his understanding  formation of intellectual cadre was the role of the school  Yet  since the latter was still not available to the majority of the population  he proposed that these magazines could serve as a favorable means to initiate such action and thereby solve the problem of culture  even if the educational work of the magazine did not substitute the need for  direct  schooling  Just as the struggle against illiteracy is different from a school for the illiterate  these magazines in and of themselves would not be a solution for the problem of culture  but could be taken as a point of departure for the creation of a new civilization  Gramsci relates the editorial activity of these magazines to the organization of cultural work  in an attempt to guide the implementation of a homogeneous cultural center for the conquest of hegemony
