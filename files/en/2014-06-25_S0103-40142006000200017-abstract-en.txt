THE AIM of this article is the analysis of the Brazilian urbanization process during the second half of the 20th century  For this purpose it is important to take note that the 1970 Demographic Census indicated that the urban population had surpassed the rural population for the first time  The rapid contemporary urbanization due to intense internal migration concentrated the urban population in the larger Brazilian cities and metropolitan areas  During the last two decades  however  the growth rates of the larger cities has declined due to lower fertility rates and  more importantly  decreasing number of immigrants  Indeed  the metropolitan area of S o Paulo  for example  presented negative net migration for the 1995 2000 period  Although internal migration trends do not point to a process of  hipermetropolitanization  it must be taken into account that as of 2000 40  of the country s urban population still inhabited the larger metropolitan areas
