The shift in the interpretations of Jacques Lacan s theoretical legacy promoted by the International Psychoanalytic Association  IPA  has increasingly incorporated the social into its clinical formulations and proposals for therapeutic intervention beyond the classical setting  The main such proposal  dubbed  applied psychoanalysis  consolidates this shift and provides the theoretical means for the diagnostic unification of individual symptoms and cultural phenomena  notably by reducing the influence of structuralism on the conceptual framework of Lacan s work  The resulting displacement of the  symbolic  in favour of a  clinical practice of the real  as applied to the social  expresses an intensification in the process of converting Lacanian theory into a discourse and device for social control  the latter being the true significance of the emergence of political and cultural issues relating to society at the core of hegemonic Lacanianism
