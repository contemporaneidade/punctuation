In this paper  I will speak about money  value and price  in their relationship with prostitution  understanding them as symbolic elements  I take as theoretical parameter Georg Simmel s contribution From an empiric point of view  I refer to the relationships of prostitution lived at the Praia do Meio  Natal RN  where I made twenty interviews with prostitutes  I noticed that money is not just the symbol of the prostitution relationships  but also of our time  Prostitution  in its turn  can also be thought as such a symbol  for even values considered to be socially positive are commercialized  On the other hand  even in prostitution the logic of money is surpassed  in the sense that in it a series of emotions and feelings that permeate the human relationships are involved  without which the modern sociability  ruled by monetary relationships  would not be possible
