The article proposes a multi level reading of The protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism by Max Weber  looking to identify different textual layers and analytic possibilities  Hence it pursues an analysis of the text at three different and complementary levels  the political  the scientific and the personal  It discusses the different versions of the text and the different contexts of publication  including an exploration of Weber s dialogue with Marx and the relations between capitalism and ascetic Protestantism  At the same time it highlights the extent to which the text can and should be read as a kind of self analysis by Weber
