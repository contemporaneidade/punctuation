This essay aims at analysing two ideological and semantic aspects of Ant nio Vieira s works  the pseudomorphosis  theme of the first part  and the contradiction  The pseudomorphosis or false form is a figure through which the superficial layer of the text would not correspond to its deeper message  based on biblical prophecies and Bandarra s ballads  Vieira creates the image of a universal and Christian Fifth Empire under which  however  one may distinguish the project of a vast Portuguese empire  As to the contradiction  theme of the second part  Vieira s missionary works reveal an acute contrast between the struggle for freedom of the indigenous people from Maranh o and the acquiescence in the enslavement of black Africans  One may also perceive contradiction between this conformist attitude and the vehement defence of equality among all men created by the same God and redeemed by the same Savior
