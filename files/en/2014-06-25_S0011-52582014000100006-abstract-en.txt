Reflections on homelessness tend to reproduce the absences identified by the gift paradigm in Western societies modern thought  The state and the market are repeatedly perceived as the only spheres of social regulation and they are interpreted as the loci from which derive the structural causes and possible solutions for homelessness  This does not allow a complete understanding of the question or a consistent reflection on ways of minimizing the injustices of living on the streets  Thinking homelessness through the gift paradigm is relevant to the extent that it enables us to identify the usual invisibility of unofficial interpersonal relations that characterize life on the streets  allowing these interactions to be revalued in the discussion on homelessness
