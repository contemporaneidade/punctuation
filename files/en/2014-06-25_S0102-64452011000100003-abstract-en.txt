The essay deals with a dissimilarity  current in the field of Brazilian political reflection  between two different perspectives  one presented as scientifically founded  the other defined as marked by interpretation  Such a contrast leads to a denial that the interpretive branch   dubbed as  Brazilian political thought  or as  Brazilian s interpretations    may generate possible cognitive effects  Moreover  the authors that belong to this variant are regularly assumed by analysts more as objects to be explained than as cognitive inspiration  On the other hand  the aim to accomplish objective and exact knowledge on political matters  as affirmed by the  scientific  variant from the 1980 s on  is determined by the desire to be free from the inherent limits and predicaments of interpretive efforts  The process is affected by an ongoing transfiguration of the object of political reflection and of the whole field of political knowledge altogether  supposed to be marked by strong uniqueness  The affirmation of such a singularity leads to a continuous effort of distinction towards the traditional procedures and assumptions of the field of humanities and social sciences
