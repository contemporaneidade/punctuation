This paper contains a critical reflection on a comparative analysis of rural development processes in Brazil  the European Union and China  It argues that those contextual elements and or process characteristics that are mostly ignored by a case study approach  for being more or less invisible and or for being more or less self evident  might come to the fore through a comparative approach  Simultaneously  the particular nature of single rural development processes might equally be specified through systematically organized comparisons  In this way  current rural development processes are characterized as a set of responses to market failures   a set of responses that requires and involves the active construction of new  nested markets
