The discussion of knowledge as a crucial source of inequality is organized as follows  First  the author presents the general theoretical context within which the discussion of social inequality will be placed  namely the development of a theory of modern society as knowledge based  Secondly  he addresses some of the characteristics of contemporary social inquiry to inequality  He indicates that most of the theories and research into the structure of inequality are linked to the theory of modern society as an industrial society  Thirdly the author seeks to show why knowledge  as a capacity for action  may be able to replace what have been for centuries  and continue to be for many observers in theory and for many others in practice  the invidious foundations of inequality of industrial society  Using aggregate economic data  he points out that transformations in the material welfare of large numbers of individuals and households contribute to an uncoupling from the once rather tight linkage or dependence of individuals and households on the labor market  The material changes made room for new forms of social inequality  specifically  structures of inequality linked to knowledge  Finally  the last section describes some of the ways in which knowledge has been employed to generate  reproduce and sustain inequalities
