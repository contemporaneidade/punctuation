Analyzing the novel Jorge  um brasileiro and considering the data produced in other researches  I consider here the relation between large development projects  labor and popular mobility  In the first place  I describe the activities of workers responsible for building roads  later I relate this topic to the issues of housing and of the relationship between workers and bosses  I argue that the experiences of these road building workers  conspicuously expressed through certain ideas related to the  road  and the  mud  offer a privileged perspective to think about some more general meanings related to labor among the popular classes considered in a broader sense  At the same time  these ideas articulate disparate themes and contexts  certain common meanings and practices relating labor  mobility  housing  person formation and conceptions about inequality
