In this article  Iris Young discusses the role of protests and direct action in democracy  Her strategy to evaluate arguments for and against direct action is a hypothetical dialogue between two characters  an activist and a deliberative democrat  Considering how both deal with conflicts and inequities in democracies and how they define good citizenship  she discusses limits and potentials of those theoretical approaches and practices  Revealing conflicts that cannot be bypassed and possible continuities between them  the author underlines that protests are needed in democracies as much as dialogue and persuasion  She criticises the paralyzing potencial of deliberative democracy  as it attempts to accomplish broad consensus
