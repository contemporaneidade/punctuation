Contrary to the latest trends  which insist on establishing linear and unidirectional relationships between the problematics of culture and workplace education  this work proposes an inverted reasoning based on the discussion of mutual imbrications between these two fields of knowledge  namely  the problematization of the multiple education forms and procedures with reference to the cultural and symbolic specificities of the organizations of work  To illustrate the relevance of this proposal  the author employs a set of empirical data collected in one of the six case studies developed as part of a transnational research project  subjecting this empirical corpus to an interpretative analysis and a confrontation with his own theoretical assumptions
