The aim of this paper is to discuss the analytical proposition of Tim Ingold in understanding the notion of Person who wants to overcome the duality of mind and body  This duality is  rethought  through the objection to the concept of  collective representation  in favor of an approach that incorporates biological principles in explaining  to conceive the person as an aspect of organic life in general  The argument developed here is that the incorporation of these principles as an attempt to overcome the mind   body dualism forces us to confront the issues in a new way  And it also questions whether the result would not renew analytical explanations that he wants to refute  It means  the epistemological basis of the french sociological school in relation to the postulate of the social foundation of cognition  This article is organized into three parts  The first  introductory  presents the social context and the recent development of the Cognitive Sciences conditions in the resumption of the theme  The second part presents the analytical perspective of Ingold understanding the notion of Person that intends to overcome dualisms such as nature and culture  mind and body  Finally  the third part  discusses the theoretical and ideological implications of the analytical argument proposed by Ingold
