This article is an ethnographic study of the ways whereby some sectors of Rio de Janeiro s elites have been playing a key role in shaping the consumption universe and  therefore  creating new classification criteria of the Brazilian society  Using newspaper evidence on the network of relations known as  The New Emerging Society  and direct observation of those elites  life style  my main hypothesis is that those elites share attitudes and a type of mentality that concomitantly cultivate the work ethics and conspicuous consumption  Such attitudes and mentality have become defining features of certain social groups at a given moment in the country s recent political economic history  Finally  based on evidence culled from the press media  I endeavor to identify the birth and functioning of a discursive system that sanctions the positive value placed on the binomial work ethics and material success  and  relying on the very notion of success  symbolically upholds this classification system
