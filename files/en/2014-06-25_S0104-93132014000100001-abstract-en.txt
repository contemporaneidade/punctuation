In this article  I intend to discuss how the political trajectory of Celso Castro  a communist militant and political exile during the military dictatorship  was being narrated and recorded after his death in 1984 during an alleged robbery in the city of Porto Alegre  From these narratives  I reflect on how trajectories  options and individual choices are discursively indexed to certain patterns of thought and to the supposedly objective conditions with which these experiences are linked  thereby seeking to produce a sense of unity and continuity in the political activism of the so called  lead years  of Brazil
