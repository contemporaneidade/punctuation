The present article is part of a theoretical line that researches the relationship between institutions  the State and economic performance  Its central object is the study of Developmental States  that is  interventionist states that performed a central role in the development strategies of certain countries  In spite of the numerous historical analyses that have been carried out regarding these experiences  the theme is considered controversial and many economists are reluctant in accepting that such states made any positive contribution  The article therefore deals with a theme that is very dear to economic science from the upstart  the relationship between State and market and its impact on the  wealth of nations  It attempts to contribute to this issue through a critique of more abstract analyses geared toward interpretation of the Asian model and the 1997 crisis  Identifying a methodological flaw in these analyses  we argue that the crisis cannot be deduced from possible institutional weaknesses in the South Korean model  Institutional characteristics  including the developmental State and large entrepreneurial groups  were the central variables used to explain South Korea s major success in the decades that followed 1960  In this regard  the difficulties of the 1990s should be interpreted as the result of a hurried process of economic liberalization and deregulation  implemented before a new regulatory structure to substitute earlier forms of regulation could be established  In refusing certain interpretations of the crisis  this article emphasizes the importance of recognizing the institutional specificities of different countries and the existence of different types of capitalism  The South Korean case  just as the Japanese one  reveals a model of capitalism in which the Developmental State played an extremely active role  constituting a fundamental variable for explaining the major success that these countries  development strategies were able to achieve
