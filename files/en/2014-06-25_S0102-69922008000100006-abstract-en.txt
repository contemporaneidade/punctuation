The present work makes an analysis on the contemporary consumer society and on the new relationships as well as new social processes that have been produced in its context  Despite some classical thesis that comprehend consumer society s expansion as a massification homogenization process and that oust the individual as a subject of the social process  for example  some approaches of the Frankfurt School  especially in Adorno s and Hokheimer s works  we intended to discuss how we could comprehend the movement of consumption expansions as an inverse movement  essentially marked for an individuation process that takes place in new forms of construction of identities and subjectivities in the contemporary society  The theoretical scheme produced by the American sociologist John Thompson  1995  was used to comprehend consumer society as a  structured social context  from where  symbolical forms  are constructed as expressions of social subjectivity
