The green economy initiative carries with it the optimistic view that the economy can and should be driven by investments in clean activities as opposed to the extraction of natural resources and polluting industries  However there are limits to the emphasis that is often put on efficiency improvements and on the substitution between sectors of an economy  For the economy to be green  the reduction in environmental impact per unit of GDP should be higher than GDP growth over a period  Even though recent evidence shows that some countries aparently passed the peak in the use of materials and energy  global extraction of natural resources and CO2 emissions has increased  A probable cause is that rich countries have outsourced polluting activities to poorer countries  It is time to bring the skepticism of reason to the debate and seriously discuss degrowth  not of GDP or of opportunities for human development  but of the global resource extration and carbon emissions
