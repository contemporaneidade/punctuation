This bibliographic essay provides an x ray view of the set of studies carried out in Brazil on the S o Paulo class associations over the 1910 to 1945 period  This period is crucial for our understanding of changes in the State and in the economy  such as state bureaucratization and economic industrialization  We have divided the paper into two different parts  The first looks at studies that take class associations as an analytical source  that is  as objective resources that reinforce the theses that the authors who study them defend  In this regard  we seek to identify how and under what circumstances associations are mobilized  In the second section  we systematize studies that treat class associations as their object of analysis  that is  not as a tool to examine something that goes beyond them but as the object to be studied in its own right  From here we move on to look at the theoretical definition that is commonly used within the literature  We end our essay with a few notes on the limits of the current conceptualization of corporatism that the bibliography we look at puts forth and suggest some directions for further research
