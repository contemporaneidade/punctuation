The article puts in perspective the academic works in the Social Sciences about Fernando Collor de Mello s impeachment process that took place in 1992  It examines authors that  when explaining the impeachment  emphasize the relevance of the president s personality  of political institutions and actors  or of the mobilization of  civil society  By means of this critical balance it attempts to outline what lacks most in the academic production on the subject  a meaningful framework that articulates all factors brought about by the literature  and even those overlooked by it  as responsible for the impeachment  Such framework should shed light on the political dynamics that made the process more likely to happen
