In the last decade  the agenda of policies of the World Bank has shifted from narrow macroeconomic reforms and structural adjustment to public sector reforms leading to  good government  and the empowerment of civil society  The objective of this essay is to obtain a broad understanding of the underlying political rationale of the new development agenda of the World Bank  concerning aspects of institutional capacity  participation  and improvement of social conditions  The argument to be developed is that the Bank has become more acutely aware that the success of its development framework depends on deep processes of social and political engineering  With its emphasis on improving social conditions and strengthening civil society  social services reforms advocated by the World Bank have the purpose of building a wide consensus  contributing to promote political stability and foster free market capitalism  In this sense  in spite of the rhetoric of a Bank of  apolitical development  its recent agenda implies a normative preference for specific attributes of Western variants of liberal democracy
