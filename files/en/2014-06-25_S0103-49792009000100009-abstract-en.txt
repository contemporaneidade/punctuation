Is the growth of a global civil society a cumulative process  or are we only seeing occasional transnational outcroppings in a sea of states  To put this question more broadly   Is the traditional divide between domestic and international politics breaking down  On this question much of the future of transnational social movement activism depends  I will first illustrate the dilemma with a story that is both current and familiar  the Olympic Torch protests in London and Paris and its connections to Tibet and Darfur  for what it tells us about the nature of transnational public activism  I will then construct a typology of forms of domestic transnational interaction among non state public actors  I will then turn   with some trepidation   to a prediction about the future of what some have called  global civil society  and how it may affect transnational activism
