The relations between social movements  political parties and the State has become  during the last decades  one of the central subjects of both theoretical inquiring and empirical research in the field of social movements studies  Inserted in this debate  the present paper offers an analytical perspective that allows apprehending distinct patterns of relation between institutionalized and non institutionalized politics and  particularly  the way in which such patterns enable distinct processes of organization and action by social movements  In order to explore the analytical possibilities of such perspective  we take the trajectory of members of the so called movement of solidarity economy in the state of Rio Grande do Sul  Through these trajectories  it is possible to identify a process of organization which does not occur only out of the State s ambit  but is rather largely encouraged by governmental policies and agents  Instead of approaching and criticizing such process as a case of cooptation  manipulation or colonization of the movement The hidden face of social movements  institutional transit and State movement intersection   an analysis of the movement of Solidarity Economy in Rio Grande do Sul of solidarity economy by the State  we seek to demonstrate it is the outcome of a complex pattern of relations between the civil society and the State mediated by political parties  and particularly by the Workers Party   PT  that has emerged and consolidated in Brazil during the last 25 years
