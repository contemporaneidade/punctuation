Distinguishing between the old and the new and analyzing the transition from the former to the latter are challenges that acquired unparalleled centrality in Max Weber s sociology of religion  This article examines how Weber dealt with these challenges and the inherent difficulties in his approach  For Weber  the transition from the old to the new necessarily requires something like a  transformation of man s soul    or a spectacular break with supposedly traditional mindsets  The argument is that this conceptualization led him to see nonexistent breaks  for example  between the Lutheran and Calvinist mentalities  and to fail to perceive important breaks  for example  between present day tolerance and that of former ages  By way of conclusion  the article contends that there is an analogy between Weber s sociology of religion and Aristotelian physics  and that Weber s view that historically significant transitions require a  transformation of man s soul  can be better understood in light of this analogy
