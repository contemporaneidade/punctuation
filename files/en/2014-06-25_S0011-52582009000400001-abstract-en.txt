This article aims to pay tribute to the social scientist Carlos Estevam Martins by reflecting on the figure of the intellectual in the contemporary world  The premise is that a transfiguration is taking place  reinforcing the trend towards overspecialization that hinders intellectuals from engaging in civic ideas and passion  Paradoxically  however  this same transfiguration requires the intellectual s active presence as a character capable of producing meanings and totalizations  and thereby collaborating with the political community to discover more advanced forms of self awareness
