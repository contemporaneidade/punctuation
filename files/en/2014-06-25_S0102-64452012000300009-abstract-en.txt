This essay tries to understand to what extent the Brazilian political and social thought  while questioning possibilities of setting up a Brazilian civilization  has left some topics to consider a democracy in Brazil  These topics were derived from different kinds of interpretations about the country  sustained in dualities such as tradition and rupture  iberianism and americanism  centralization and decentralization  State control and social autonomy  In order to link these subjects to understand the characteristics of a democratic thinking  we have analyzed the works written from the Empire to Republic by Visconde do Uruguai  Tavares Bastos  Euclides da Cunha  S rgio Buarque de Holanda and Gilberto Freyre  Futhermore  we have remarked how political science and sociological analysis advocated a demiurgical action of the State on society and developed a sort of understanding about sociability
