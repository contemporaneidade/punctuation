This article examines recent struggles over the mobility of Roma across Europe in terms of the insights that these provide into the limits of European Union  EU  citizenship  Showing how the struggle to deport and contain Roma citizens across Member States of the Union reflect a broader series of limits regarding EU citizenship  the analysis questions any simplistic assumptions regarding the progressiveness of European citizenship over national citizenship  Rather  it points to the constitutive tensions between citizenship as derivative of the nationstate and citizenship as formed through free movement provisions  and reads these tensions as important in understanding the conditions under which contestations of the limitations of EU citizenship emerge  Focusing specifically on the struggles of Roma and Sinti activists in Italy  the article goes on to suggest that questions of mobility are critical to the transformation of European citizenship through  acts of citizenship  that contest the limits of an EU citizenship regime  This is not understood in the sense that free movement automatically or inevitably rights the wrongs of territorial or nationally inscribed regimes by including those who are excluded  Rather  the article argues that mobilisations of Roma around mobility are important both in contesting the internal differentiations of EU citizenship  as well as in reconfiguring the limits through which such a regime is inscribed as such  This occurs through acts whereby exclusionary processes such as criminalisation are transformed into claims to social justice  Such claims might be said to take on new significance when developed at the European scale  since claims to social justice in this regard become  transnational  in the scope of their enactment  However  the transnational cannot be understood in a fixed or spatially contained sense when viewed through the lens of mobility  but is perhaps better understood as a means of questioning received ways of thinking and enacting politics that are confined to the individual or to the aggregate constitution of nation states
