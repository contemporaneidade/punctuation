Animal biotechnology is providing new tools for animal breeding and genetics and thus contributing to advances in production efficiency and quality of animal products  However  the progress is slower than anticipated  mainly because of the difficulty involved in identifying genes that control phenotypic characteristics of importance to the animal industry  Three main strategies  QTL mapping  candidate genes and DNA and mRNA sequencing have been used to identify genes of economic interest to animal breeding and each has advantages and disadvantages  QTL mapping allows identification of the genomic region that contains the genes  but the confidence interval of the regions is usually large and may contain several genes  Candidate gene approach is limited to our restricted knowledge of the biological function of the genes  Sequencing of genomes and expressed sequences tags can provide identifying gene position and metabolic pathways associated with phenotypic trait  Integrating these strategies using bioinformatics software will allow identifying of novel genes for animal production  Then  animal breeding programs will include the information from DNA directly on evaluation of genetic value of livestock production
