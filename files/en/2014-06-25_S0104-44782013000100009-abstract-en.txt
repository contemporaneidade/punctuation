The object of this article are laws approved between October 5  1988 and January 1  2009  that awarded tax benefits to entrepreneurs  related to three taxes which fund social actions of the Brazilian federal government  PIS  COFINS and CSLL  The objective is to analyze if the formulation of these laws was marked by a concern with assuring the transparency  efficiency  efficacy and effectiveness of the benefits   all of which are fundamental values for good public policies  To this end  we analyzed the origin  the species and the exposition of intent of the legislative proposals that awarded tax benefits to the entrepreneurs  as well as the content of the approved laws  The main conclusion of this article is that the concern with above mentioned values seems to have been very limited  This is particularly problematic given the ever growing number of laws that award tax benefits  and the gigantic volume of tax exemptions occasioned by them  The award of tax benefits to entrepreneurs can be characterized as a distributive policy  Lowi  1964  This type of policy  with concentrated benefits and dispersed costs  tends to provoke intense lobbying of their potential beneficiaries  and a much weaker mobilization   if any   of the payers  This bias in favour of special interests may threaten the public interest  However  this is not an unavoidable threat  Tax benefits can collaborate to produce good economic results  as it happened when they integrated a list of sucessful measures brought about by the Brazilian government to mitigate the internal effects of the international crisis of 2008  Then  the challenge which remains is to face the risks with a proper institutional architecture
