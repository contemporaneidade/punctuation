In this paper I analyze the representations of the migrant women at the audiovisual founds in some of the organizations that work with gender and immigration in Barcelona  At the audiovisuals I have found a recurring association of the migrant women with poverty  criminality  ignorance  passivity  undocumentation  gender violence  compulsory and numerous motherhood  prostitution  etc  Thus  I tried to understand the ways in which these representations are shaped  studying the narrative  stylistic  visual and verbal elements through which these images and discourses of the migrant women are articulated
