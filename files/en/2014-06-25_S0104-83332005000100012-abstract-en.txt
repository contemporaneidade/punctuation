This paper analyzes body representations and social practices related to intersex children and teenagers by contrasting the viewpoints of medical doctors and the patients  relatives  It is based upon two analytical categories  the gendered view of anatomy and the visibility invisibility of sex  The main arguments suggested here are that sex is as culturally built as gender  and that the boundaries between the natural and not natural are easily blurred when it comes to defining what fits and what does not fit social norms
