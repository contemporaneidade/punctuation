The different participatory experiences emerging in Brazil during the decade of the 1990s came together  as Tatagiba has argued  in turning the country into  a hotbed of innovative management experiences  One outstanding experience is the Participatory Budgeting Or amento Participativo  OP  Program  which over the course of the years has been the stage of intense debate and study  garnering both admirers and critics  Yet notwithstanding its fame and the many studies that have been made of it  few researchers have sought to evaluate the program s performance and sensitivity to municipal government  This article examines the participatory budget program in Porto Alegre within the period spanning 1989 to 2008  making specific analysis of the program s sensitivity to changes inadministration  that is  fromtheWorkers Party Partidodos Trabalhadores  PT between 2001 2004 to the PMDB  Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement or Partido do Movimento Democr tico Brasileiro  from 2005 2008  In other words  we ask whether the change in the political party at the head of city government made a difference in terms of program performance  Our analysis indicates that the program has been highly influenced by the political party responsible for its implementation  This can be seen as evidence of low levels of institutionalization  even in the municipality where the program has been most successful  that is  in Porto Alegre
