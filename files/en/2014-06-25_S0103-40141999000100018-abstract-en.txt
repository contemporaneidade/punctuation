THE SO CALLED DEPENDENCE theory is here scrutinized in its political aspects and as political economy  with the purpose of opposing it as a theory in itself  once it does not present methodological elements either significant or innovating in their content  The notion that dependence exists is tautological  Strictly speaking  there is no dependence theory  but merely dependence as a historical process within the international system of force and power relationships  The Cepal academy debates have dealt with the capitalist development at the periphery  more precisely with the consequences of central capitalism in Latin America  a chapter on the interpretations related to the development underdevelopment condition  which involves the role played by the so called historical agents in social changes  In their search for a dependence typology  the oversimplication of the butterfly collectors in social sciences does not create a new theory  but merely ambiguous general principles
