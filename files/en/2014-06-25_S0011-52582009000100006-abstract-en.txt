Data from a sample of nearly 12 thousand speeches on the floor of the Brazilian House of Representatives from 1999 to 2006 show that Brazilian Congresswomen expound on different issues as compared to their male counterparts  Does this reflect a different perspective by women  as some contend  or does the insulation of Congresswomen within these issues represent the reinforcement of a stereotype that impedes their access to central positions in the political field  In the latter case  the difference is due not to a distinct female sensitivity  but to the limited opportunities open to women in the political field  In other words  the themes that are most permeable to women s presence are associated with the least prestigious positions  This establishes a political division of labor  relegating Congresswomen to the positions least amenable to the accumulation of political capital
