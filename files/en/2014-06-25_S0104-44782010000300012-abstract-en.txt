This article engages in critical discussion of the perception  common in studies on the Brazilian electoral system  that proportional representation with open lists is an effective obstacle to accountability  Such a perception is  to a large extent  based on mistaken views of the character of electoral ties in Brazil and the sense of accountability  seen as a relationship between voters and their candidates rather than between constituencies and their representatives  A focus on the flaws in the electoral system  on the other hand  leads to obfuscation of other aspects that are more important for perfecting representation  related to the democratization of information and the strengthening of civil society  Problems identified on open lists are better confronted by widening public debate and strengthening civil society  which would enable voters to take a more consistent advantage of the opportunities for choice that are offered to them  wider than those that exist in other electoral systems
