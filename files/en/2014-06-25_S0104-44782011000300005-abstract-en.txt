In Brazil homicide rates have reached alarming levels  Most of the analyses carried out within Political Science neglect the relationship between violence and the quality of democracy  The Economist Unit  2008 s Index of Democracy evaluated Brazil as a country with high ratings for civil liberties  Yet it considered aspects of civil rights overlooking homicides  This led the prestigious English journal to arrive at the mistaken conclusion that Brazil fared better in terms of civil liberties that countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom  This paper seeks to analyze Brazilian democracy by incorporating this indicator  homicides  as well  Quality of democracy is our dependent variable and Pernambuco state death rates due to violence are taken as our independent variable  In order to measure democracy  we evaluate the role of coercive institutions and their inability to contain homicides within the state  Our results suggest that high death rates related to aggression may be seen as an obstacle to the consolidation of democracy in Brazil
