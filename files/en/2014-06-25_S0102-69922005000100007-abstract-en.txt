The social and psychological consequences endured by friends and relatives of people victimized by violent death  homicide  suicide or accidents  are analyzed on the light of gender differences  Current literature suggests that women and men face traumatic experiences in different ways  However  traumas also vary by gender  raising questions about how much of the differences are due to gender or to the type of trauma  We hypothesized that women are more susceptible than men to post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  when the traumatic event is common  We compared the trauma symptoms and the meaning of the loss of loved ones  A sample of 425 women  62  and 265 men  38  was drawn from a list of people that suffered violent deaths in the city of Rio de Janeiro and were interviewed in 2003 4  Fifty four percent of the women and 41  of the men had their daily routines altered after the death of a relative friend  There are statistically significant differences concerning health problems and entertainment practices  Half of the interviewees seriously reduced leisure  The contact with the corpse is intimately correlated with the PTSD symptoms  Controlling the extension of the contact  corpse recognition  seeing it  but not recognizing it and not seeing it and not recognizing it  women were more affected than men  The article concludes that women feel the losses more deeply than men  but part of these differences are not  intrinsic  to genders  but depend on social capital  on institutional contacts and personal interactions
