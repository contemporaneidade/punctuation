Starting from the perspective that foreign policy is a public policy  i e  the state and government in action at the international level  this article discusses t he conceptual and political implications of the n ew configuration of Brazilian foreign policy  By considering foreign policy as public policy  the authors break its automatic association with crude versions of Realism and bring it to the field of politics  thus recognizing that its formulation a nd implementation f all w ithin the dynamics of governmental choices which  in turn  stem from negotiations within coalitions  bargaining  disputes and agreements between representatives of diverse interests  As a result  the text removes foreign policy from a condition linked to inertial and supposedly self evident and or permanent national interests  protected from injunctions of cyclical nature related to partisan politics  and strips it of features generally attributed  or preconceived  to so called state policies  Finally  the authors suggest avenues for an innovative research agenda  such as  i  advancing sociological  organizational and institutional debates on the role of diplomatic agency  the process of learning and transformation  and the need to establish new institutional arrangements   ii  rethinking the place of diplomatic agency in public administration  and  iii  incorporating comparative spatial and temporal perspectives in foreign policy analysis  in order to broaden our analytical capacities on contexts and contradictions  These moves allow the reader to understand how systemic opportunities  different national and historical contexts  multiple state and non state actors  domestic and inter transnational agendas play a role in foreign policy  especially in countries with characteristics similar to those of Brazil
