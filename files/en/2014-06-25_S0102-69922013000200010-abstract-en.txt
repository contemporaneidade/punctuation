The law that justifies the inclusion of people with disability in schools and companies has been in force since the end of the 1980thies  In view of its coercion  people with disabilities have been enrolled at schools and been employed in companies  This research attempts to analyze the inclusion process according to Axel Honneth s Social Recognition Theory  Backed by his three dimension recognition process  we show firstly that inclusion signifies a process of individuation and social inclusion  Then  we study the law in force  its goals and strategies of achievement  We show that recognition s approach allows interpreting the law of inclusion more generously   in a less positivistic way  Finally  we approach the conditions for schools and companies to accomplish the law of inclusion so conceived
