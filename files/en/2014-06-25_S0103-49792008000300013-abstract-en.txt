Based in propositions of the theory of reception  in the field of sociology of the culture  this paper discusses the role of the cinematographic review starting from two positions  the one that defends  author s movies  and the one that assumes a supposed end of the critical function  The persistent debate opposing art or author s movies  refined  to  easy  industrial and massive ones seems as old as movies themselves and reduces movies to the mere opposition of  art versus industry  That seems still today as an fulcral argument in the field of criticism  The complexification of cinematographic and artistic thought implies in a displacement of its reception and  consequently  of its sociology  In that sense  one intends to debate the possible relocalizations of concepts  such as the ones that reduce movies to high  versus  low  and  educated  versus  vulgar
