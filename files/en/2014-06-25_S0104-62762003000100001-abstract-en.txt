There is no clear consensus whether attitudes supportive of democarcy and democratic citizenship constitute a single attitudinal domain  or are empirically distinct from each other In empirical studies os attitudes and behavior in Bulgaria  Chile  Greece  Hong Kong  Hungary  Italy  Spain and Uruguay  we find clear evidence that such attitudes ares both conceptually and empirically distinct  forming three different attitudinal performance of democracy  and political disaffection These threee clusters have distinctly different behavioral correlates  disatisfaction leads to votes against the incumbent party  a lack of diffuse system support is associated with votes for anti democratic parties  and disaffection leads to low citizen involvement in democratic politics  We find no consistent evidence that diffuse support for democracy is dependent on satisfaction with the performance of democracy
