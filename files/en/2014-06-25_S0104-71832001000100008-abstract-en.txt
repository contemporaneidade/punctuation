Having as a starting point that the  politics  constitutes a relational universe where the  local  and the  national  are social planos  fields  on which certain relations objectify themselves  and not autonomy spheres which are comprehensive in themselves  this article tries to demonstrate that we can understand certain political practices much better if we don t get stuck in one of these poles and to the presuppositions which they are articulated to them  of oppositions like this one between the local and the national  Para isso  So   Having this intent    it takes the elaboration and execution steps of the Annual Federal Budget Law as a privileged moment of the politics exercise that allows to exam some of the relations and conceptions that link the politics professionals situated in the different spaces of political authority  in the city and the country  In this analysis  I follow two argumentation lines  1  that the interests around the federal recourses  and the practices and conceptions associated to them  are subscribed in a complex system of mutual and asymmetric relations and dependencies  that is constituted  among others  by municipal leaders  parliamentary and governmental authorities and private agents  and 2  That the action of these last agents leads to a specific conception of political representation
