Within the limitations of this article the authors analyzed various elements of the wave of transformations which have occurred in the scope of the world s capitalist economy over recent decades  These transformations have led to measures against trends aimed at blocking and overcoming the structural crisis resulting from stagnation after a long period of post World War II growth  In contradiction  at a time in which the changes that were introduced have proven to be powerful leveraging tools for innovation in the production and finance arenas  their content is also thoroughly regressive  Capitalism has undergone a profound transformation  but without the consolidation of a solid new base to increasingly reward big capital in order to replace the cycle which ended in the early 1970s  The  underdeveloped  and  emerging  countries reproduce  with some particularities  these contradictions under the domination of financial capital  Thus  capitalism s new model of reproduction currently shows visible limits  It prolongs the organic crisis which is developing regressions which threaten human destiny  but not without creating new bases for overcoming anti capitalism
