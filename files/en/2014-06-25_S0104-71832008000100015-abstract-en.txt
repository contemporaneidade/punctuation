After a long period in which his work was neglected or despised by Brazilian academia  and admired principally by non Brazilians with little knowledge of Brazil  a re evaluation of Gilberto Freyre s ideas and style got under way during the 1990s  sorting out the incisiveness of some of his ideas from the superficial character of others  and trying to separate out facts from the myths created about him  some of which were of his own making  This article discovers the heterogeneity  if not the promiscuity of the young Freyre s reading  which may explain why he disconcerted his readers for so long  since it was hard to place a simple label on this individual who was clearly anti racist yet also rather conservative  It also unmasks the  myth of the myth  of racial democracy   a term which Freyre never applied to Brazil except with hesitation and qualifications
