Horizontal accountability is a key challenge to new democracies  and especially so in those regimes where  reactive  legislatures face dominant presidents  Although the 1988 Constitution gives impressive legislative and agenda setting powers to the Brazilian president  it also equips the legislature with a set of oversight tools that can be used to monitor or scrutinize the powerful executive  In analysing a large database of oversight initiatives between 1988 and 2005  we trace broad trends and patterns in the overall usage of oversight tools and attempt to isolate the political and institutional conditions under which they are deployed  We find that the use of oversight mechanisms has risen in recent years  that oversight is mediated by measures of presidential popularity and by the size of the pro presidential faction in Congress  and that oversight responds to the logic of Brazil s coalitional politics  driven by the shifting context of the executive legislative relationship under multiparty presidentialism
