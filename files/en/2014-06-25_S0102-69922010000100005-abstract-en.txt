It is generally accepted that analyses of knowledge production and technological artifacts lack a multidisciplinary approach  Particularly the interaction is very weak between analysts who adopt sociological approaches and those who study scientific knowledge and technological artifacts from an economic perspective  This article reports an attempt to integrate these two modes of analysis  identifying the main differences and convergent points between them  It is argued that while Economics overlooks important elements for the understanding of these processes  such as the interests of the social actors  the power structures and the influence of the political aspects   Sociology  disregards many of the basic economic aspects of technological production  such as economic agencies  institutions and systems  The result is the occurrence of vague spaces of analysis that could be better explored if a complementary effort existed between both disciplines  This study explores the possibilities of dialogue between one approach of Economics thought  represented by the Evolutionary Economics  EE  and two approaches of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge  represented by the Social Construction of Technology  SCOT  and the Actor Network Theory  ANT  arguing that the analytical categories of each approach may complement the others  thus allowing a more consistent characterization of the production of technological artifacts
