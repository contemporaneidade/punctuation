Authors such as Michel Foucault and Franz Fanon have been influential figures both in studies of questions relating to strategies of power and representation in post colonial contexts  and in the theoretical debates and analyses surrounding post colonialism  In particular  the notions of bio power and governmentality  originally found in Foucault s thought  and Fanon s reflections on the construction of forms of racial and colonial subjectification  have enabled a wide debate on the permanence and circulation of transnational racial rhetorics  Through a reading of David Scott s Refashioning Futures   Criticism after postcoloniality  1999  and Paul Gilroy s Against Race   Imagining Political Culture Beyond the Color Line  2000  this essay seeks to identify the pertinence of combining both authors in studies that  in different ways  rely on the complex relationship between body and modernity and its implications in the present day political and intellectual fields
