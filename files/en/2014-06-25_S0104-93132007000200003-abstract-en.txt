Following the arrival of in vitro fertilization techniques at the end of the seventies  a worldwide debate soon flourished on the status of the embryo produced within the laboratory and on its use in experimental scientific research  The purpose of this paper is to analyze and compare two of these debates as they unfolded in the British and Brazilian Parliaments  The former resulted in the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act  while the latter led to the provisions of the 2005 Biosafety Law concerning embryonic stem cell research  Exploring the anthropological literature on the topic  the analysis aims to show not only the contemporary opening up of the borders of the  human  to explicitly political forms of negotiation  but also the main vectors directing such negotiations in the case of scientific research using human embryos
