This paper focuses on the different interpretations of the Brazilian Education Law of 1966  with special attention to its article 33  reformed in 1997  which regulated the implementation of religious studies in public schools in Brazil  This regulation referred to schools of elementary and secondary levels that are administered by State Governments  through their Secretaries of Education  thus leaving to the States the task of applying the law  We are here considering two specific cases  that of the State of Sao Paulo and that of the State of Santa Catarina  showing how these different interpretations of the law conditioned the possibilities of religious agents to act in the process of capacitating teachers as well as in the definition of the contents of the curricula
