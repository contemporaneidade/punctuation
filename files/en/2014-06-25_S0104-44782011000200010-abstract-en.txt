This article looks at theories of political development in poor countries that have been produced in the United States and that base their scientific practice  research  classification and selection of themes  on a particular representation of what defines these countries  Our underlying question is an understanding of the passage from a developmentalist and economic representation to a view that is more centered on stability and order which taking place in the 1960s  For these purposes  we focus initially on the series Studies in Political Development  of the Committee on Comparative Politics  This object provides us with a privileged vantage point from which to see the transformations that classical theory had to undergo in order to move on to the new theme of instability  Finally  our analysis of Huntington s classic works shows what the characteristics of the emergent representation are  Two key aspects are studied  i  the representation of poor countries and the relationship that is established between the theory of political development  the theory of economic development and modernization theory and ii   ii  the meaning of political development  The analysis of the works we have spoken of indicates that  through the introduction of the theme of instability  the theory of political development is consolidated as a relevant and autonomous field of study  since this theme enables us to conceptualize its object   political development   and to argue that it cannot be completely encompassed by social and economic modernization
