This article discusses the indigenous political movement which has been consolidated in Roraima State  Brazil  since the 1970s  through the strengthening of indigenous identities  focusing above all on the Macushi and Wapishana  An analysis is made of the interface of these identities with Brazilian and Guyanese national identities  on the international border  which became clearly defined after this border was demarcated in 1904  The ways in which these identities overlap  and exist together simultaneously as contextualised identities is examined among the indigenous peoples who inhabit this region since long before the international border was imposed
