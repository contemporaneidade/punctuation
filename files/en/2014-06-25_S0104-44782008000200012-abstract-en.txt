Within economic and sociological literature  research relating the process of the internationalization of the capitalist economy and social protection system reforms within developed countries abounds  The main goal of this paper is to carry out a critical review of such literature as it deals with the challenges that Welfare States pertaining to this  new  socio economic environment have to face    Our goal is to discuss to what extent  globalization  restricts national governments  policy making options  This diminishing of scope and options leads to a convergence in macroeconomic policies and consequentially  a convergence in the ways in which the State s relationship to the social fabric unfolds  Existing literature presents arguments that can be divided into two currents  The first group of works  which we will refer to as  minimalist  argues that Welfare State policies have a characteristic which is difficult to modify  since they can be seen as  blame avoidance  policies in which no politic actor is encouraged to take responsibility for possible changes  Thus  although there may be fiscal incentives for a reduction in the role of the State  there would be no reduction in state efforts to confront social dilemmas  Running counter to this position  the  maximalist  viewpoint focuses attention on the qualitative changes in social protection that result from new patterns of State society relations and their role within the economy  In this regard  although public spending on social policies has been largely unaltered  there has been a change in the nature of intervention  dislocating it more toward policies of  helping those in need  rather than focusing on equal rights  We argue that differences in diagnostics result from normative and conceptual views of the Welfare State
