An ethnographic research project developed in Lisbon s graffiti community between 2005 and 2007 forms the starting point for exploring the social condition of young members from this community  This article looks to add to the theoretical debate on urban youth cultures  invoking key concepts like creativity  agency and identity in this particular cultural universe  The graffiti writers live between two social and cultural worlds  evolving complex strategies to manage identities and everyday life  For many young people  graffiti represents a ground for their struggles and transgressions  a chance to reject the law and hegemonic norms  an arena where they can experience excitement  risk  behave heroically and  sometimes  suffer painful sanctions  In a safety obsessed society  danger becomes a space for freedom where young writers can challenge the limits of life and normative boundaries  This is why there is often a feeling of release and autonomy  of escaping the disciplinary control of social norms and worldly habits and why their exploits appear to be imbued with greatness and heroism
