This paper discuss the relationship between deliberative approaches of democracy and critical theory  In order to do so  it presents three arguments that suggest a deep distinction between these two theoretical traditions  1  Deliberation reinforces existent forms of domination  2  Deliberation has accepted the existent democratic liberal institutions  3  The empirical turn of deliberative literature has brought it closer to traditional theory  Based on these arguments  the article highlights the existence of an instable dialogue between the deliberative approach and the Frankfurtian legacy
