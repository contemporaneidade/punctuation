The paper discusses the logical implications of thinking the technological change as a form of capital  as suggested by T  W  Schultz for the aims of economical analysis  We argue that proposals like this  made by the founder of the human capital theory  are currently opening space to think the human as a form of capital   even before the birth of a human being  We consider what Michel Foucault called  the political problem of genetics  in his The Birth of Biopolitics  and reflect about the social and economical implications of genetic information  in particular  when the object of study of economics is extended not just to some human attributes  now considered as a form of capital  but also to technical progress itself
