ONE OF the main purposes of science is to show that  the world is intelligible  by human reason  This attempt at a rational comprehension has an history  which is closely linked to that of sciences  but also to that of techniques and of philosophy  and also with scientific creation  We examine the relationship between social construction and historicity  by putting emphasis on the importance of knowledge contents  that do not let themselves be dissolved in the external conditions of their constitution  All the richness of historicity shows itself in the organic way in which these contents are woven from materials of the empirical world assimilated in rational constructions  Historicity itself becomes intelligible to us  and allows us to conceive widenings of rationality that allow opening  invention and progress of knowledge
