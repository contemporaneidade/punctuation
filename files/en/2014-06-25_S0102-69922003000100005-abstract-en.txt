The premise of this article is the understanding that there is  among the Brazilians  the existence of a horizontal and disseminated environmental conscience that does not consist with a daily practical concern on the subject  That is  even faced with the diagnosis of a global ecological crisis or the growth limits of our current socio economic standards  the individuals seem to act towards their self destruction  The question is  what makes well informed individuals  who were taught how and why to act correctly  choose not to do it  How do you explain this phenomenon  In this small article  we propose an approximation between the environment issue  with its irregularity between theory and practice  and the theoretical methodological instruments proposed by Elster
