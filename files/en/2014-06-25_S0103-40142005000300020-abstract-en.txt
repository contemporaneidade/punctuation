IN THIS ARTICLE  several contexts  scopes and circumstances in which the use of the majority rule seems to be a proper use  in opposition to others in which it makes no sense  The automatic association of majority rule to democratic political systems is certainly inappropriate  because these systems ordinarily aggregate both elections and appointments  The rule also seems improper when it involves questions of science  irreversibility  consciousness and personal integrity  It is a very complex thematic and an attempt in order to undervalue it may drive only to aporias  as suggested by the title of this article
