The Amazonian myths collected among certain Panoan speaking peoples which make reference to the Inca figure have generally been subject to one of two interpretations  They are either seen to recall a remote past in which these peoples may have been ruled by Quechua aristocrats or they are seen to be structural aspects of identity or cosmology  in which the Inca would be representative of the White man or of some celestial alterity  These interpretations  in spite of their heuristic value  serve to limit our understanding of structural and historical aspects of the Pano Inca  This article proposes that we also try to understand the Pano Inca as an effective symbol  related to social and or artistic models with their own distinctive values  people such as the Shipibo Conibo and the Kaxinawa have shaped around this figure a tradition which sets them apart from the neighbouring Nawa groups
