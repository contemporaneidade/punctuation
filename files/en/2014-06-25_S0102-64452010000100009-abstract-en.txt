The article considers the history of more than two decades of a collective action for defense of social and civil rights in the eastern S o Paulo  This trajectory gives empirical ground for a reflection on the relationship between contemporary politics and poor neighborhoods in Brazil  I argue that this relationship has always been marked by conflict  The course of this conflict has had three forms that coexist  which have succeeded each other in dominance  1  political struggle for rights  central to the actions of  social movements  of the 1980s and 1990s  2  social management  conducted by the State and by local organizations  present in the internal logic of  social programs  from the years 1990  and 3  violence  present or latent in the police repression in urban outskirts and today mainly regulated by the  criminal world
