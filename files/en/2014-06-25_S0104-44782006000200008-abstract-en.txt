Since the last decades of the twentieth century  South Am rica has been undergoing deep political and economic changes that have moved the continent in a more democratic and liberal direction  Nonetheless  processes of political democratization and economic liberalization have not converged spontaneously within the region  On the contrary  these two structural processes have demonstrated considerable incompatibility  In answer to the neo liberal agenda that was hegemonic throughout the 1990s  new leaders and governments have emerged at the turn of the century with more nationalist tendencies and tending toward the left of the political spectrum  Yet the heterogeneity of these movements contrasts sharply with the uniformity that prevailed in the immediately preceding decade  This article attempts to provide a brief description and explanation of these South American movements and counter movements  The basic argument is that the rise of new leaders to power is nothing more than the plural way in which these societies have attempted to react  through the vote  to this contradiction of their times  The article provides a brief discussion of the rise and fall of neo liberalism within the region and the limits of the nationalism that then emerges  as well as of the populist turn taken by peripheral institutionalism  It concludes by suggesting that the conventional analytical division between institutionalism and populism  or between neo liberalism and anachronic nationalist models  will not take theoretical debate nor the practice of democracy very far  In truth  the contradictions of recent decades are promoting the re definition of politics in South Am rica  for the new century  in ways previously unseen and whose final results cannot be foretold
