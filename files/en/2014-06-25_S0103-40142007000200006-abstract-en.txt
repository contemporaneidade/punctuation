It is essential for children to feel that the years they spend in school help them understand the reality they face in their daily lives  Children  more than adults who had the opportunity to travel  see the world in comparison with the city or neighborhood where they live  The space they refer to is local space  It may be wise to forbid children to play in a stream in the city  But understanding that particular stream and why it is polluted  and who pollutes it and how  allows them to anchor abstract knowledge in the concrete reality they know by experience  Besides  how can we expect adults to participate in the development of their regions if they have never studied anything about them  We produce children who know the length of the Nile  but are incapable of reading a city map when adults  who never studied the potentials and problems the reality they will have to face  We may follow the example of a small place in the Northeast  Pintadas  where the children are now taught the characteristics of the  semi rido  of the concrete problems dry regions present in such fields as agriculture  watersheds  environment and so forth  The author of this paper is an economist convinced that in this era of knowledge economy we need to share knowledge in a more balanced way  Teaching children to understand their own space can be a powerful instrument to promote children s interest and adult citizenship
