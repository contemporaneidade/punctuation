The aim of this article is the distinction between power and violence in Hannah Arendt  It has two parts  The first makes a presentation of Arendt s definition of power  The second consists of some critical comments  beggining with a defense of the  theoretical tradition  criticized by Arendt and then sorting out two related problems of her interpretation  the suppression of conflict from political life and  therefore  the limited heuristic value of her concept of power  The article concludes that the absence of conflict in Arendt s theory of power is based on a radical distinction between the political and the social worlds  Finally  it suggests that  though her definition of power as  action in concert  touches on the central issue of  organization  such definition does not take in account the effects of the latter on political equality
