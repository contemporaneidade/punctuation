Controlling intelligence services is one of the most difficult political tasks at hand  since there is an inherent tension between such services and democracy  In a democracy  the transparency of public data and discussions around them are valued  while intelligence activity demands secrecy  If this is a difficult task in consolidated democracies  it can only be more so in the case of fragile democracies like the Brazilian one  Within the latter type  decisions made by civilian powers that upset the military stir up anti democratic pressures which are often denied yet insinuated  Within any negotiated transition  the new democratic government is expected to make some concessions to the military  in the sense of preserving some authoritarian institutions  This is the price of negotiation  yet these concessions are supposed to be temporary  The Brazilian Intelligence Agency  Ag ncia Brasileira de Intelig ncia   ABIN  is a typical example of institutional hybridism  it presents both characteristics of democratic change and authoritarian conservation  However  as time transpires  an institutional involution can be observed  Militarization is its most evident trait  This is what I intend to show in this paper as I look at the creation of the ABIN and its institutional trajectory over the course of the Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz In cio Lula da Silva administrations  My methodological option involves the use of instruments coming from Rational Choice Theory and ethnographic research  My underlying premise is that micro details influence institutional evolution or involution  This narrative enables me to identify problems of collective action  veto power and credibility of commitments  as well as cultural aspects linked to individuals and or society that influence the shaping of political priorities
