This article analyzes the theoretical propositions of Raymond Boudon s methodological individualism  which seeks to disassociate itself from perspectives that emphasize the notion of instrumental rationality such as understandings of rational choice  Differences between instrumental conduct and the idea of cognitive rationality proposed by this sociologist hark back to central themes of contemporary social reflection  most specifically the possibly problematic ties between the sociological tradition and a certain economic ontology  To reveal the particularities of Boudon s methodological individualism as well as his notion of cognitive rationality  I first expound on his major critiques of the instrumental paradigm  I then go on to debate the alternatives he suggests  particularly the notion that agents incorporate beliefs or theories simply because they have  good reasons  to do so  as well as his notion of  diffuse rationalization  Finally I seek to analyze the way in which this French author s theory points to flaws in the economistic view of rationality  although presenting some propositions that are lacking in precision  Thus  while he signals the important lack of connection between individual agency and social context that inheres within rational choice theory  Boudon elaborates a universalist conception of rationality that seems to overlook the circumstantial and defined bases of social reality
