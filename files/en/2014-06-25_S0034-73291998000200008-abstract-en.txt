This article presents an analytical framework of the influence of ideas over Brazilian contemporary foreign policy formulation  focusing on Brazilian performance at the League of Nations and the United Nations  In both organizations  Brazil has aspired to perform an international leading role  which  as we argue  constitutes an indicator of the recurrence  in the diplomatic discourse  of certain beliefs about what should be Brazilian status  role and belonging in the international arena  Simultaneously  the article argues that such analysis should not only reconstruct the diplomatic discourse but also try to unfold the causal mechanisms that explain the impact of those beliefs in the policymaking process  In this sense  the international academic literature has already developed a series of approaches that might prove useful to the study of Brazilian diplomacy
