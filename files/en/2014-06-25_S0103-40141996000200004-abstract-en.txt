Freud s experience in the field of empirical science  at the beginning of his carrer in Vienna  is reviewed and admitted as still relevant in the years in which psychoanalysis was developped  Freud was successively zoologist  with Claus  physiologist  with Br cke  and psychologist  with Meynert  before creating his talk therapy  This would have enabled him to forecast that the advances in neurosciences and drug therapy might conflict with psychoanalysis  The compatibility between neurosciences and psychoanalysis  as defended by Mezan  is emphasized  in terms of each having its own purpose  Exemples of efforts to explain mechanistically the mind are evoked  as well as the recent revival of the concept of cognitive unconscious  Freud s position in relation to philosophy is briefly approached  as well as his view towards positivism  His frustrations   the lost chances of conceiving the neurone and prescribing cocain   are remembered  In spite of the theorization implicated in psychoanalysis  Freud remained residually a natural scientist  as he once proclaimed himself
