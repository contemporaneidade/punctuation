After a brief introduction to the social and historical background of the time in which Leni Riefenstahl directed her most famous films  this study will focus on how the filmmaker used images of athletes in her film on the 1936 Olympic Games  which is known as Olympia  1938  The idea is to explore the gap between the date in which the event was held  when it was important to show the world a pacified Germany  and the date the film was screened  approximately 18 months later  The main goal is not to discuss the political use to which this film was put  but rather how technical and expressive features in Olympia highlight political  social and historical aspects of that period
