This paper examines the effects of the social policy reforms on the institutions of the system of social protection during Cardoso s government  In order to do this  it focuses on three groups of programs  the universal  health and education  those of labor protection and unemployment benefits  and the programs to eradicate poverty  State or market  Employment and income or social policy  Universalism or focus  Such disjunctives are considered inadequate to describe the project and the implemented measures  The reinforcement of universal and free public programs  of health and education  cohabited with the introduction of market signals in the work field and with the instruction to focus on the universal so as to improve the distribution impact of the policies  This did not alter the basic directives of the social protection system  However  the emphasis on programs of monetary transference to impoverished families  that took place during the second term in office  was a detour from the original government project and a change in the traditional protection scheme
