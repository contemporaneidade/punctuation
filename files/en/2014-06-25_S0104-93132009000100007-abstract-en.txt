Through an examination of French abolitionist Victor Schoelcher s account of Haiti published in 1843  this article interrogates anthropologist Rolph Trouillot s interpretation of the  unthinkability  of the Haitian Revolution  While the Haitian Revolution has been ignored  distorted  and treated with incomprehension and disdain in the West  the use of the notion of  unthinkability  to interpret its reception contributes to another form of incomprehension by eliminating from consideration the political and historical contexts that are constitutive of resistance  Schoelcher s text represents a remarkable effort to  think  Haiti and the Haitian Revolution from within the presuppositions of French Republicanism  His interpretations demonstrate the broad range of possibilities within Enlightenment thought  They converge with the thought and practices of the Haitian masses and the enslaved population of the French West Indian colonies  but they do not coincide with them  The non identity of their thought forms the space of politics between Schoelcher and slaves and is a necessary ground of historical analysis
