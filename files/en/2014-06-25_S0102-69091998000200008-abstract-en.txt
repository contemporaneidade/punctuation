The article discusses some problematic aspects related to the notion of strategic rationality as it has been developed in the context of game theory  The emphasis is particularly placed on the game theoretical pretension of providing unequivocal criteria for rational choices under uncertainty  as uncertainty is an element of so called strategic interactions  where individuals try to foresee each other s actions when trying to achieve their ends  In so doing  however  the theory usually overlooks the element of endogeneity that typically surrounds these interactions  It is contended that an extremely rationalistic approach to strategic interactions  as well as to their peculiar uncertainty  is detrimental to the rational solution of the situation  Moreover  it is suggested that the intellectual cooperation between game theory and the institutionalist research program is most welcome for that matter  The institutional approach here focused has its roots in the social philosophical tradition that poses the question  what can we know  starting out from a peculiar vision of the social world where individual rationality plays a limited role
