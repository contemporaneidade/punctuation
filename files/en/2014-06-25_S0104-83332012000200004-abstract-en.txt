This paper analyses the preparation of food in Western Europe  16th 19th centuries  focusing on its gendered dimension  Three main variables are considered  social stratification  geography and time  It suggests that in Italy  Spain and France in early modern times the cooks employed at the courts and by the aristocracy were generally men  a feminization of the preparation of food started in France from the 18th century onwards  In Central and Northern Europe women were much more involved in the preparation of food in the upper classes  too  even though the fashion for French cuisine in the 17th and 18th centuries implied a growing recourse to male cooks  The paper suggests explanations of these differences and trends over time and discusses the role of nurturing and cooking for the definition of the female identity in different contexts
