The author discusses the significance of G  H  Mead s social psychology to Habermas s social thought  Two streams of the American pragmatism   the analytic philosophy of language and the behaviorist psychological theory   are united in Mead to criticize the philosophy of conscience  In spite of naming its theory as  social behaviorism  Mead breaks with classical behaviorism in so far as he emphasizes the individual s internal experience and presupposes the  social whole  in it  Finally  the article shows how the theory of communicative action claims to incorporate and  at the same time  to overcome that approach
