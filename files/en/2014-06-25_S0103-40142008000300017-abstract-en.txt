This text represents the second chapter of a study on Robaldo s trajectory during his oscilation between the faustian bargain and the tradition of the so called  Bildungsroman   Bildungs   und Entwicklungsroman  Taking an excerpt of the novel The Man Without Qualities  in which Musil discusses the obstacles imposed on 20th century narrative art  as a starting point  and putting forth theorethical reflections by Adorno  Auerbach  Rosenfeld etc  the essay focuses  in the first chapter  on the features of Guimar es Rosa s novel The Devil to Pay in the Backlands that would connect it to a more primitive epic  Here  some relationships with Thomas Mann s Doctor Faustus  which also has the diabolic pact as a central motif  are established  As to the present text  it is directed towards the shapes and images that Riobaldo s report gives to the concepts of  evil  and  devil   as well as their interminglement  Then  it focuses on the character Herm genes  who embodies a kind of principium maleficum  which can hardly find a parallel in Western literature  In order to expose this specifity of the Rosian character  the study goes on to a comparision with the representation of Evil  and its corresponding character  in Grimmelshausen s barroque novel  Simplicissimus
