The aim of this paper is to resume  in an indicative and preliminary order  the debate on the crisis or the historical decline of trade unionism  The question we want to raise is this  union activity  in the 2000s  is indicative that the Brazilian trade unions overcame their crisis  Our text analyzes a cycle of strikes under way in Brazil since 2004  stressing  among other elements  the number of strikes and strikers  the offensive nature of these strikes and the victories that workers have been obtaining in their demands  We support the hypothesis  still under investigation  that union activity in Brazil in the 2000s is a very strong indicator of the mistake in the thesis of historical decline of unionism
