This paper approaches the relationship between associativism and democracy in the presence of significant social inequality  Relying on specialized literature  it suggests that such relationship is boisterous because of social inequalities resilience  as well as limitations peculiar to associational practices  A safer way to cope with political inequality  thus enhancing democratic legitimacy  seems to be the straight line that goes from the reduction of social inequality to a lesser political inequality
