LUCIEN Goldmann s literary studies fall into two distinct phases  In the first  relying mainly on contributions of the young Luk cs  Soul and form and The theory of the novel  Goldmann sought to establish a homology between the novelistic form and social life  Moreover  falling back on History and class consciousness  he sought to give a historicist and dialectical treatment to the youthful texts of the Hungarian thinker by interpreting literature as an articulate expression of the  views of the world  held by various classes and social groups  In the second phase  marked by pessimism and the influence of structuralist ideas  then in vogue  Goldmann s essays ceased to seek mediations between the written work and social life  Taken by surprise by the maelstrom of 1968  Goldmann engaged himself in a self critical movement  interrupted by his premature death in 1970
