After more than 30 years of reform and opening up  China increasingly faces challenges in maintaining its sustainable development and defining its role in the world  The rest of the world is readjusting its strategy to a rising China  and China must build favorable external relationships not only for its sustainable domestic development but also for its rising international status  Against this backdrop  China has proposed a strategy of peaceful development and harmonious world order to reassure others of its peaceful intentions and future world vision  In doing so  China values cooperation among emerging powers  especially the BRICS  Compared to the unequal interaction model of the G8 5  BRICS offers an independent platform for emerging powers to work as a group within current international system  China treats BRICS members as major development partners besides traditional ones  like minded peers regarding world affairs  and new forces in reforming international system  China has confidence in the future of BRICS though aware of the existing differences and distrusts among members  Since its grand strategy is to rise peacefully and constructively  China prefers BRICS as an emerging progressive and cooperative international force to a collective blocking force
