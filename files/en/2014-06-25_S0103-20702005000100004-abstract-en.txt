This article is about the progress of Brazilian left wing intellectuals  especially the artists  after the 1960 s  In it  we develop the hypothesis of the existence of a structure of feelings of revolutionary Brazilianism  strong until 1968  as an answer to changes in social organization  and how it tended to become de structured when the whole of society went in another direction  The works by the artists who shared this structure of feelings shared something familiar but there was no total identity among them  at times  they were rivals  The process of conservative modernization of society would professionally institutionalize the artistic and intellectual milieu  keeping it apart from the commitment with critical causes of order  The historical constraints in which certain structures of feelings bore fruit dried up  and  many times  those feelings were transformed into an ideology that legitimized the Brazilian cultural industry
