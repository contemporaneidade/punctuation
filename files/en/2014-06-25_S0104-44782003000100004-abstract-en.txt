This article reports results of a research  based on empirical and positivist premisses  that studied the environmental discourses and practices of transnational firms  TnFs  in Brazil  When the research was concluded  it became evident that the use of critical theory would have permitted a greater understanding of these TnFs  environmental practices  In this regard it is demonstrated that   based on data obtained in field research carried out in Brazil  critical realism is a more useful approach for explaining the environmental practices of TnFs in developing countries  Finally  it suggests that analyses based on realist approaches are necessary  since TnFs are the firms that are primarily responsible for generating and disseminating managerial and technological knowledge related to environmental issues in numerous sectors of industry
