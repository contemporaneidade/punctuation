This paper argues that the conjugation of certain democratic  socioeconomic and political factors has led to the  nationalization  of presidential elections in Brazil since 1960  The expansion of the electoral market resulting from urbanization and the growth in the electorate  together with the progressive removal of the obstacles to voting   due to income  gender  age  and education   has democratized the electoral process by diversifying the social make up of the electorate  Since then  the president s election has ceased to depend solely upon rural political forces and now involves multiple combinations of rural and urban political forces  Candidates can no longer count on specific and numerous social groups in order to guarantee their election  and need to widen their appeal  Based on the results of the direct presidential elections of 1960  1989  1994 and 1998  the author contends that the  nationalization  of the vote as described above is part of the political integration of Brazilian society and that this  together with the social complexity of the electorate  means that the candidate s appeal and political stance need to be more wide ranging in order to prevent potential conflicts from arising during the election campaign
