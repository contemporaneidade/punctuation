Globalization is changing the way we argue about justice  Arguments that used to focus chiefly on the question of what is owed as a matter of justice to community members now turn quickly into disputes about who should count as a member and which is the relevant community  Not only the substance of justice but also the frame is in dispute  The result is a major challenge to our theories of social justice  which have so far failed to develop conceptual resources for reflecting on the question of the frame  The article argues that in order to deal satisfactorily with this problem  the theory of justice must become three dimensional  incorporating the political dimension of representation  alongside the economic dimension of distribution and the cultural dimension of recognition
