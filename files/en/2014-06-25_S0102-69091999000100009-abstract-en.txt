This paper points out the inverse proportional relationship between the democratization process in Brazil during the 1980 s and the increasing levels of violence in Brazilian society  as measured by mortality rate statistics  The authors analyze mortality rates from external causes and extend the research to the number of life years lost through violence  according to Arriaga s methodology  for the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area  Comparisons are made with the S o Paulo Metropolitan Area  other regions of Brazil and the Argentine capital  Buenos Aires  The relationship between violence and the structure of social relations is mapped from a number of specific characteristics observed in Brazil  to provide a basis for a  dense phenomenology  and a causal explanation  Finally  the article proposes greater interdisciplinary research as a means of discovering more about why these changes are occurring and to contribute to a debate on civil rights and affirmative action which might address this public health problem
