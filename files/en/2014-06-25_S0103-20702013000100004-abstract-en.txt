This article analyzes two instances of prisoner action and representation of prisoners in the S o Paulo penitentiary system  the Solidarity Commissions and the Primeiro Comando da Capital  PCC  Our hypothesis is that obstruction of the mechanisms of inmate communication and representation legitimized by the authorities stimulated the formation of prisoner groups  which imposed themselves on the prison population through violence  while simultaneously seeking to  legitimize  themselves through denunciations of the deficiencies in the prison system and through the codes of conduct formulated in the crime world  The analysis draws from the national and international literatures on prisoner groups  as well as material from official documents and the press
