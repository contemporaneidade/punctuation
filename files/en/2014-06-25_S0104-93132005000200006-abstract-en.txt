In the second half of 2000  I accompanied the final phase of a land occupation campaign in Rio de Janeiro state  Organized by the Rio de Janeiro Landless Workers Movement  MST RJ  this campaign involved a series of preparatory meetings  called mass front meetings  Starting with a description and analysis of some of these meetings  I examine how the campaign process unfolded  Focusing on the viewpoint of the organizers  I present the adopted strategies and discuss their limitations  possibilities and contradictions  From a wider viewpoint  the text looks to contribute to the current debate concerning the formation of social movements in Brazil  To this end  I point out the limitations of two kinds of approach  those which claim social movements form more or less spontaneously  and those which perceive these processes as new forms of reproducing old models of the boss employee relationship
