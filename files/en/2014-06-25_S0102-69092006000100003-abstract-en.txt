This article examines the new forms of political representation civil organizations have been constructing in their relation with the State  as well as some of the possible consequences for the quality of democracy  There are no historical or theoretical established models of representation which would enable one to explore how civil organizations  in the absence of the mechanisms of elections or formal membership  could construct their political representativeness  That is precisely why political representation by civil organizations has received little attention despite its growing importance  Extensive fieldwork in S o Paulo has revealed that political representation by civil organizations is closely connected to the dynamics of institutions of representative democracy  Furthermore  it reveals that  alongside notions of representation that are clearly irreconcilable with democratic norms  a new notion of representation has emerged among civil organizations  which is specifically political and compatible to democracy
