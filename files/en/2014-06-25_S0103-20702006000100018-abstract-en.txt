This article proposes a critical analysis of the contributions of Niklas Luhmann and Gunther Teubner to the development of the Systems Theory of Law  STL  Its main hypothesis is that the authors in question converge towards a shared critique of the basic theses of classical sociological theories  which assert that law is an epiphenomenon of the social relations of a variety of agents and their distinct interests  individuals  classes  corporations  parties  and so on  In contrast  Systems Theory claims that law can be analyzed as a social subsystem which  based on the operation of its own code  imprints a meaning and content to the communications of the action s agents  This not only means that law is created by social relations between agents  but that law also creates realities that guide the actions of agents
