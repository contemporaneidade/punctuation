This article analyses the manner how Margaret Mead conceived and utilized the pictures taken by Gregory Bateson in Bali  1936 1939  to develop her study  almost ten years later  about the balinese children behavior  There are some limitations in this balinese photographic study caused by methodology adopted  and by the political ideological bias that crossed her research realized during the  cold war  period as well  I try to discuss these limitations and to synthesize the approach s possibilities of the images  Photographic plates are selected and reproduced here to show different perspectives of their use  in Mead s balinese works and in the Atlas of infant behavior produced by the doctor Arnold Gesell
