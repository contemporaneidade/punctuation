We bring to bear here an ethnographic study involving a peculiar psychic experience  the  self help  theatre  a kind of ritual theatre created by Brazilian psychic medium Luiz Antonio Gasparetto  Involving unusual relationship between psychic ritual and theatrical staging  this practice spawns innovations in ritual psychic performance  an issue that is just beginning to receive appraisal in relation to  Spiritist  religious field  Its principal issue  here also analyzed  is the criticism to models of virtue associated with the Christian Spiritist matrix  The latter becomes the key target of self help practices and ideologies which have tended to embrace the values of consumer society  The notion of personhood   as casted in this type of performance   is also a theme of analysis
