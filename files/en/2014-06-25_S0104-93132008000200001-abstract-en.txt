This article investigates the factors that contributed to the intellectual ascension of Tarde during the 1890 s  Taking into account the fact that the author lacked the necessary academic credentials for a university career  I seek to show that Tarde obtained prestige among circles of intellectual and political power that were contrary to the growing autonomy of the university and the social sciences  Groups affiliated to the pedagogic pole and the technical professional pole were still hegemonic in the 1890 s  but they began to contend with Durkheim for the legitimate definition of the new disciplines  As part of a strategy of maintaining hierarchy  these groups elected the social psychology of Tarde as an instrument for combat  The author lived up to expectations and accumulated social capital in diverse intellectual and political fields  being thereby amply rewarded
