The article explores the value and limits of agency theory by comparing relations between ranchers and their managers in Rio Grande do Sul and Buenos Aires during the first few decades of the 19th century  Agency theory and the rational choice perspective are based on a deficient theory of action  assuming presocial actors who use a universal rationality to choose the most effective behaviors for attaining their objectives  Even so  agency theory is useful for identifying central dilemmas in the principal agent relationship and for delimiting the set of viable solutions  As actors generally do not try to optimize their choices  but instead look for satisfactory solutions for the problems they encounter  only history and culture explain the  choice  of one viable arrangement and not another  Context and experience are internalized as habitus and practical consciousness  which shape the definition of problems and strategies for solving them  The ranchers studied here approached similar questions of agency in different ways  Part of this was due to divergent contexts  but much of it was related to their distinct habitus  stemming from the origin of the Argentine rancher in the colonial merchant class  lacking rural experience  and the origin of the Brazilian rancher in an elite of military officers and ranchers  dependent on the state  In both cases  repeated interaction through time led to important changes in the relationship between rancher and manager that are difficult for rational choice approaches to explain
