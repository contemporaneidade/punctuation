This paper presents ethnographic data obtained during the author s fieldwork in sports bars in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  providing the basis for a theory of  football joking relationships  The notion of the  joking relationship  is well known to anthropological theory  due in particular to the classic article  Parent s   plaisanteries  by Marcel Mauss  published in 1926  though its origins can be traced back to earlier works by authors such as Robert Lowie and A  R  Radcliffe Brown  This paper connects the playful expression of feelings to the symbolic universe of football in Brazilian society  Voluntary support for a favourite club enables the fan to take part in a series of  games  associated with football  but parallel to it  such as betting  verbal duels and challenges  which involve the symbolic logics of honour  gender and power endemic to Brazilian society
