Through their everyday references to witchcraft  allegedly emanating from Afro Brazilian cults  Evangelical pastors denounce heinous crimes and acts of barbarity that provoke horror and terror in their listeners in church and on radio and television  I describe two allegations of witchcraft by Pentecostal groups  which connect marginality  crime and the presence of diabolical evil in two communities  Witchcraft provides an entry point to examine some of the problems faced by those living in  communities  the  demonization  of peripheral territories provoked by the state s identification of their populations with criminality  on one hand  and the Evangelical battle against diabolical evil  on the other  I look to show that in the community of believers and the favela alike the Evangelicals  battle with the devil is a response to the State s interpellations associated with its modalities of identifying peripheral spaces  In the process  I analyze the meaning assumed by witchcraft within the wider Evangelical project of salvation and the social future it aims to build
