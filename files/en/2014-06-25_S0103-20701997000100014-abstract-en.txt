Democratic consolidation in Brazil continues to be confronted with challenges  in general  presented by legacies from the authoritarian regime  Democracy coincides with the economic crisis and a reduction of the state capacity to provide for services  Police performance is not improved in the democratic transition  much to the contrary it deteriorates  Violence and arbitrariness are also not reduced but grow with its inefficiency  The image that the public had of the police during the dictatorship is not re structured but it continues to be negative  This bad image is sustained by the police s poor performance  by its violence and arbitrariness and by the lack of externals controls over the police and thus of institutional channels for people to voice their complaints and qualms about police behaviour  Thus people are kept between the need for public security that should be provided by the police and the disbelief in it and even fear of it  The extreme ambiguity people feel towards the police  people tend not to trust the police but mistrust does not translate into demands for improvement of police performance or in demands for control over it  Much the contrary  mistrust often goes hand in hand with an acceptance of the arbitrary behavior from the police  The objective of the paper is to examine some of such contradictions
