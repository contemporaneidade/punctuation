This article seeks to present part of the reflections made in my doctoral thesis  in which I analyze the meanings of the revival of practices and discourses about the  removal  of favelas in Rio de Janeiro today  This paper will discuss one of the constituent dimensions of what I call  repertoire of removing  the  legacy  that will achieve the mega sports events that the city will host  the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics  The current urban interventions are resulting in significant changes in the flows and uses of city space  causing even the displacement of some residents of slums  This process has been translated by the public authorities involved  as well as in relation to other interventions  such as a  legacy  allowed for achieving these mega events  This configuration represents an important alteration in the conformation of the  slum problem  at this conjuncture
