My proposal for this article is to discuss the free mobility of workers inside the Mercosul block  bearing in mind that this liberty  in the contrary of others issues that arise as essential aims to be reached in the integration process of the region  wasn t incorporated in the Assun o Treaty  signed in march 1991  This absence is revealing in the sense that the liberty of circulation of persons is one of the elements that show with more evidence the existence of an integration process as it affects directly the life of its citizens ensuring their free displacement inside the region and equal opportunities among nationals and no nationals  In the text of the above mentioned Treaty  integration appears only in reference to the circulation of capital  goods and services  being this liberty safeguarded by the elimination of any obstacle which could damage this road  Enlarging this discussion  I intend to look up what institutional advances has been reached in the course of the process  in the sense of the inclusion of measures which lead to the opening of the borders of Mercosul countries through which its citizens   in our case  the workers   could move with liberty and could live in the place where they work  To discuss this point  I believe that the knowledge of European experience is of great utility
