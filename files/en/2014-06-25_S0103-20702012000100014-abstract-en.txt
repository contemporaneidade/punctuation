The article intends to reconsider the critique of Theodor Adorno s Social Theory formulated by J rgen Habermas  In the first part of the text we analyze in detail the reasons Habermas enounces to leave behind the dialectical criticism of the process of social rationalization  In order to put forward our objections to Habermas  interpretation we reconstruct  in the second part  two essential thesis  which became displaced by the paradigm of communicative action  and which had served Adorno to elaborate his criticism of the prevailing modernization process  As a conclusion  we propose a different understanding of the roll played by communication in the constitution of contemporary societies  through an analysis   based upon Adorno   of the relationship between language and rationality
