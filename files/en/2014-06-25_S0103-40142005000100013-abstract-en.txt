THE  RO AS DE CABOCLOS  are the slash and burn agricultural units of traditional populations dwelling in the lowlands of the Brazilian Tropics  generally in association with forests  They are derived from the indigenous system with some modifications introduced by the Africans and Portuguese  In this paper we analyse the community structure of the  ro as  and the role of biological and cultural factors in maintaining and augmenting the genetic variability in the most important species planted in ro as  the cassava  Manihot esculenta  There is a high degree of diversity in the  ro as  and the several species that are normally present  like cassava  sweet potato  yams  arrowroot  ari  cup  and peanuts present what has been called ecological combining ability  meaning that they optimize their use of environmental factors and resources by minimizing the overlap of their architectures  The variability of cassava is amplified by the seed bank in previously occupied sites  interspecific crossings and intervarietal crossings   facilitated by the planting arrangements chosen by the  caboclos  After being created  the variability is fixed through vegetative cloning  the usual reproduction method not only of cassava  but also of the other species of the  ro a  mostly perennial and showing  agronomical disjuntion  that is  reproduction and production effected by different organs of the plant
