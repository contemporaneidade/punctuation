The proposal presented in this thematic dossier had its origin in a cooperative network of researchers working in France and Brazil  The theoretical and methodological interest of the authors is to outline the emergence of different forms of work and employment  along with their web of social relations  within a comparative and multidisciplinary approach  This dossier deals with the social instability  it intends to report and reflect on the employment relations of today in different countries  considering a North South comparison  The proposal here is to use the concept of social instability taking into account the analysis of the work  the employment relations and their institutionalities  Social instability is here interpreted as a broader condition of instability and insecurity at work  Even though the notion of precarious work commonly refers to the insecure and unskilled work  the notion of precarization adopted here is related to a social process of institutionalization of the instability  The concept puts into perspective a dual process  one of economic instability  resulting from wage flexibility and the restructuring of production  and another of institutionalization of the instability  resulting from legislative changes related to labor and social protection  Our argument is that the concept of social instability makes it possible to define the institutionalization of the instability  and to configure its justification as if it was an acceptable moral value  good enough to be addressed individually by each agent in the self management of their careers and their social integration  The process of social instability raises the work to a dimension of moral value  which allows us to include the issues related to work within a social theory of greater scope  The Critical Theory of Axel Honneth makes a notable contribution to the process of understanding the paradox between a normative conception of emancipation and the potential for destruction of those elements of emancipation  Our intention is to discuss the different labor and employment relations  to bring new ways of thinking about the social significance of the transience of social ties at work in the current phase of capitalism
