Most democracies combine democratic and authoritarian practices  leaving us with a hybridized subtype  The current project examines variations in the degree of democracy and searches for its causes across the Brazilian federation  In particular  the project examines variations in the degree actors outside the executive  especially legislators and civil society  can play an assertive role within budgeting  Budgets are often legally attributed to legislatures  at least for authorization and oversight  yet  most executives monopolize the institutional  political  and technical capacity to play a forceful role in the complex process of managing public resources  In Brazil  however  there is evidence of growing legislative assertiveness and democratic practice in some regions  and this trend reflects wider processes of democratic deepening  The current project examines some of the conditions for democratic deepening in Brazil  a country that formally returned to democracy in 1985 but has consolidated a federal system of uneven democracy  To identify the conditions that lead to democratic deepening  the study highlights trends in four states  two where deepening has occurred  and two where it has not  The project demonstrates the curious result that political conditions  especially levels and types of political conflict  determine the degree of democracy as expressed in budgeting
