This paper describes a very popular and traditionally male practice in Florianopolis  the song birds  tournaments  The ethnography on the  Curi  Nerve  or the  Curi  Braveness  contests intends to demonstrate gender representations that are present on sing birds competitions of agonistic aspect in which a male is expected to intimidate and subjugate another male by his own chant  The  brave curi  is  a fighter   that does not have any physical contact with his opponent  The one that produces more chants wins the competition  attesting his virility and the male fighter superiority over the other contestants  The interesting point here is that there is a profound identification among the bird and his owner  and the bird performance reverberates on the identity  and particularly on the masculinity of the owner  This ethnography makes evident not only the representational aspect of gender  but also its relational and circulational aspect  The element that gives potency to the masculinity in dispute on these contests is the relation  Gender appears here as reciprocally built on relations of male female animals and on relations among masculines and feminines
