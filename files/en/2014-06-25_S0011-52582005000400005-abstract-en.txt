Brazil suffered an energy crisis in the early 21st century  The purpose of this article is to show how the crisis was caused by a kind of institutional blindness  Using the language of the time  I refer to the crisis as a  cognitive blackout  The proposed explanation is that the constraints produced by the evolution of the Brazilian economic culture and conjuncture provide the basis for the cognitive bias and framing that the issue gained at the time  They produced a version of modernity centered on praising the market principle and its corollary ideas such as spontaneity  the short term  and  small is beautiful  All these notions blinded public leaders and other opinion makers to the idea of long term planning and the perception of risks that ended up materializing in the energy crisis
