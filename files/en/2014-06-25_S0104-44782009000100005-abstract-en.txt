This article looks at political instability in Latin America  particularly for the countries that make up the Andean region  the Southern Cone and Brazil  We inquire into the causes behind the emergence of new political leadership in these countries and the relationship that such leadership has with situations of political stability or instability  We sustain that the emergence of new leadership in Latin America  which has emerged within a dynamic of political stability and instability cannot be understood solely through hypotheses that give salience to populist traits or flaws in processes of political modernization  Rather  deeper causal explanation for the appearance of such new leadership should be sought in the new cleavages that demonstrate the renovation of elite groups  as well as the emergence of ethnic and social divisions and of new patterns of relationship between social movements and new leadership  We conclude that the rise of new political leadership in the countries that we analyze is generally linked to a legitimacy crisis within the political system  We also hold that  neo populism  may be an explanatory variable for the emergence of new actors in contexts of political instability  but care must be taken to give adequate emphasis to contextual factors
