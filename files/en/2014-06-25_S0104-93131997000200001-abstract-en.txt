Supported by a reading of the historical and ethnographical literature  this article addresses the political consequences of the adoption of remnants  remanescentes  as a legislative term describing indigenous groups and rural Afro Brazilian populations  and discusses the analytic and theoretical limits of the current polarization of  race  and  ethnic group  in Brazilian social sciences  Proposing the concept of  plastic identity  it analyzes the thematic and conceptual convergence of recent studies based on these two classifiers and questions the stability of their separation through recourse to a number of documented social situations  This concept allows a reflection on the close relationship between scientific production  juridical training and political action  Finally  a proposal is made to rethink the lifeworlds of communities designated  remnants  in terms of ethnic emergence and cultural invention
