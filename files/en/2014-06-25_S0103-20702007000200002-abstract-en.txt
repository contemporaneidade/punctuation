This article studies the judicialization of politics in Brazil  based on an analysis of a database containing 3 648 ADINs filed between 1988 and 2005  Examining this data  the overall impression gained is that ADINs are now a normal part of the everyday running of the modern Brazilian democracy  their institutional presence consolidated over almost two decades through successive and different governments   and even more firmly in the current Lula government  Over this time  they have functioned as a channel for the conflicts between society and the State  as well as conflicts within the Public Administration and the Federation  Hence  as well as being an instrument for the defence of minorities  their original constitutional function  the research shows that the ADINs are also a strategic institutional resource for government  turning the Federal Supreme Court in practice into a kind of Council of State prevalent in countries with unitary governments
