The purpose of this paper is to analyze the determinants of the fiscal balance within Brazilian states during a period of great economic instability  the decades of 1980 and 1990  Our main argument is that even within a context of fiscal adjustment  factors related to the ideological inclinations of the head of state level executive power  to the decision making capacity of legislative power at the state level and the relationship between the states and federal government are fundamental parameters for understanding the country s fiscal situation  The methodology we use to verify our theoretical model corresponds to economic analysis of the panel  also known as aggregate series  pooled time series   cross section analysis  which enables us to concomitantly consider space dimensions  states  and time dimensions  year  For estimating model parameters  we employ the  panel corrected standard error  method  OLS with standard error corrected  suggested by Beck and Katz for panel analyses similar to the one we present here  Our results corroborate the prediction of the importance of considering federation sub units  Analyses that attempt to explain the performance of national macro economic management are not able to neglect the relevance of sub national institutions and their impact on the incentive structures of the actors who are involved in decision making processes
