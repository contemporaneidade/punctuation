During the 1980 s so called New Republic in Brazil  a conviction was disseminated throughout rural employers  organizations of  a real rural war  and of the  unavoidability  of violence as the only effective action to stop land occupation and the demand for agrarian reform  The aim of this work is to demonstrate   based on the debate on the mainstream press   that defense and practice of violence by big landowners and rural businessmen is structuring and reflects an habitus that links past and present in one reality  Violence discloses the content of class relations and displays the contents of old and new standards of conduct  In the 1980s  it worked to reinforce solidarity and the sense of belonging  also serving to strengthen even further owners  conviction of superiority over rural workers  It is not an individual and sporadic act  it is ritualized and institutionalized violence that implies creating militia  hiring gunmen  having a death list and promoting massacres  And in such context  there is little distinction between the new businessman and the traditional landlords  or the  civilized voice of the cities  from the  roughness of the ends of the earth
