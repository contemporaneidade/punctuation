Both the situation of employment in France and the frameworks used to analyse flexibility have evolved considerably over the last twenty years  The paper aims to describe this transformation and defend a particular thesis  Our post Ford modern world has two new aspects when compared with the traditional functionalist analysis  on the one hand  the tensions inherent in the ambivalent nature of flexibility are today seen as more personal issues  and on the other  ambivalence is no longer seen as purely dysfunctional  but to have a possible positive aspect  Given this new framework  the paper first presents the background to the various debates on flexibility in France  and then shows the links between flexibility and sociological ambivalence before presenting empirical data in support of the thesis
