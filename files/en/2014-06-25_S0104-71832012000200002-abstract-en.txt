This paper presents a case study which took place in the extractivist community in C u do Juru  in the Amazon  about the manufacturing process of a thread from the tucum palm leaves  an endemic specie in the Amazon region  The whole preparation process of the thread  as well as its different forms of use  show peculiar ways of socializing and producing  as well as transmitting traditional knowledge  The thread and all the products made from it are biodegradable and do not pose any risk to the forest life cycles  resulting in a path towards sustainable development in the region  Bearing in mind that we live in a planet threatened by recurring environmental crises as a consequence of the development oriented model of progress  one could argue that the traditional knowledge bestowed upon the younger generations constitutes a manifestation of important cultural heritage
