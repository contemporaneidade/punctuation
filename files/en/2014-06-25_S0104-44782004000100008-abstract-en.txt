This article discusses aspects of the political debate that took place in the second half of the 1950s  representing a set of practices that went beyond that particular moment of Brazilian history  we concentrate particularly on the crisis that occurred around Juscelino Kubitschek and Jo o Goulart s election and taking office   which took place in 1955   as seen through texts published in two daily newspapers which took opposite sides during the crisis  the Correio da Manh  and O Estado de S  Paulo  We are interested here in showing the continuity that can be found in the 1946 1964 period  this can be seen in practices revealing a contempt for elements of confrontation and struggle in politics and accompanied by widespread disenchantment with electoral processes and the population s ability to make judgments  We place particular emphasis on two topics  1  the role of the masses in politics  and a corresponding critique of the elites and of the  current state  of democracy in the country  seen as faulty or incomplete and 2  the role that is given to the press in light of this recurrent diagnosis  Our considerations regarding the positions taken by the two newspapers that we study belong to this discussion  which in turn brings considerations regarding the connections between liberalism and authoritarianism  democracy and military coup  to the forefront
