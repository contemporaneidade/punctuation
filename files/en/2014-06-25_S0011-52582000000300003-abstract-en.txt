All presidential cabinets formed in Brazil between 1985 and 1998 included politicians from more than one party and could  in principle  be defined as coalition cabinets  The article evaluates to what extent this is a valid statement as far as the legislative behavior of the cabinet parties is concerned  An indicator is proposed for measuring the rate of cabinet coalescence  based on the ratio between the percentage of ministerial posts held by each party represented in the cabinet and the percentage of legislative seats held by each of these parties  Regression analysis is used to ascertain what impact the rate of cabinet coalescence has on the legislative discipline of cabinet parties  In addition to this coalescence index  the study also tests the effect of electoral cycles and the ideological range of cabinets on legislative discipline  Results indicate that the legislative discipline of cabinet parties is only consistent with what would be expected of coalition governments in parliamentary regimes when the cabinet displays a relatively high rate of coalescence  Findings also show that the party support to president tends to decrease over the course of the president 146 s term and that the greater the ideological distance between the president and a given party  the lower the support rate this party will display for the head of government
