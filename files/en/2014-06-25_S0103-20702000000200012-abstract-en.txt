This paper examines the repercussion of Emilio Willems  life as an immigrant on the conceptual and thematic perspective given to his intellectual work  Being an outsider  a feature inherent to those who move between different creeds  cultures and values  was the human experience that directed this researcher of German origin  He focused on cultural change  conflict of values and the rationalization of ambiguities  Differently from the work of other foreign visitors  Willems  does not present a nostalgia for the  other  or for the  one far away  and it echoes the improvised character of the adventure of his journey from Berlin to Brazil in 1931
