This essay is based on a talk I delivered at Texas A M University on December 10  2005  in response to an earlier lecture at the university by Professor Samuel P  Huntington  It relies on social science evidence to first address Huntington s contention that Mexicans are overwhelming American borders  It then turns to evidence that Mexican Americans are in fact assimilating culturally but still have been less economically successful than the descendants of earlier European immigrants  The essay examines factors that have differentiated the Mexican American trajectory of incorporation and are likely to continue to do so  Finally  it calls for the American public and policy makers to make well informed choices about what levels of immigration are desirable and who should be admitted  to improve immigrants  economic opportunities through education  and to embrace a multilingual and multiethnic future for the country
