Why Thought and not Theory  The Brazilian Political and Social Imagination and the Spectrum of Peripheral Condition  1880 1970  Why do we refer to Brazilian political reflection as Thought rather than theory  The hypothesis I intend to explore here is that in Brazil  themain reason for the term  thought  to refer to the country s intellectual products lies in the fact that the elites have always considered such products more or less inferior to those developed in Europe and the United States  due to their own more general perception of Brazil s peripheral status  To frame this question  I will discuss the terminological issue of  theory  and  thought  in the field of political science  Next  I will examine how some leading Brazilian scholars assess the country s place in the world and the quality of its intellectual products  especially those of a social and political nature  This analysis will be divided into two periods  the first pertaining to the predominance of the cosmopolitan cultural paradigm fromthe late 19th century to the 1920s  and the second with the nationalist cultural paradigm  lasting nearly until the late 20th century
