Emotions have achieved a certain prominence in recent studies of collective action  Based on a rationalist conception of the latter  many of the authors concerned have developed a cognitive view of emotion adhering to a western tradition of thought that divorces the rational from the irrational  mind from body and private from public  Emotions thereby become factors capable of explaining people s motivations in collective actions  In this article I review part of my ethnographic study of recovered factories in Buenos Aires in order to analyze emotions as political practices  I suggest shifting the debate away from irrational rational action and towards an understanding of political practices as embodied experience  This aim in mind I analyze the workers  descriptions of the moment of occupation  This reconstruction shows us the importance of emotion in articulating the experience and in pursuing their claims  At the same time  the public display of feeling enables the workers to legitimate their demands and garner political support
