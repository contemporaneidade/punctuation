Is power bad by nature  Is it always in the wrong hands  No  This is the answer given by the political classics of Modern Age  Niccol  Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes  Machiavelli distrusts the ancient promises of good regime and human virtue  He bases political power on the productivity of the evil  Despite sharing Machiavelli s profound anthropological pessimism  Hobbes relies on the virtue of the sovereign  the Leviathan does away with perpetual war  In the 20th century the philosophical apologia for power assumes a different shape  Hannah Arendt separates instrumental violence from communicative power  turning the agora into the magic place of power  Contrary to that  Michel Foucault denies the existence of any privileged place of power  For him  power becomes a network of social relationships ambiguously combining subjection and creativity
