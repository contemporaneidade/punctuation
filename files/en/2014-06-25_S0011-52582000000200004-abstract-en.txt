Prostate cancer  PCa  is a major health hazard  In the USA alone  it affects approximately 10 million men  Its incidence is higher than Breast Cancer s  BCa  and it kills approximately the same number of men per year as BCa kills women  Nevertheless  PCa receives about six times fewer federal funds for research and prevention  We have investigated epidemiological trends  the growth of federal funding for medical research  and the political organization of PCa and BCa interest groups in the USA  We argue that discrepancies in funding stem from the combination of two factors  1  the relative strength of each interest group and 2  the social consensus on the relevance of each disease  We argue that men  especially older and black men  are at a disadvantage in the public policy arena
