The article aims to analyze the interventions of Quentin Skinner and Philip Pettit in the current disputes on the meaning of the concept of liberty  It argues that despite differences of method and style between the authors  both Skinner and Pettit converge to the advocacy of a republican ideal of  freedom as the absence of domination  which is neither reduced to the ideal of self government of active citizens  positive liberty  nor to the ideal of simple absence of coercion on agents  negative liberty  Although the republican liberty   la Skinner and Pettit is also characterized by the absence of interference  it differentiates itself from the dominant liberal view in that it repudiates only the arbitrary forms of interference   phenomena of dependence and domination   which corrupt the relations amongst citizens as well as the relations between the citizens and the state  Non arbitrary forms of interference may be beneficial to   or even constitutive of   liberty
