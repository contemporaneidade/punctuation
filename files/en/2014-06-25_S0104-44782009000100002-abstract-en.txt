This article analyzes Hegel s political thought  through the prism of his Philosophy of Law  I present a systematic exposition of Hegel s concept of philosophy  which made politics a necessary consequence  given the fact that his theoretical system sought to establish a unitary logic  In elaborating the present text  I have employed a very simple criteria  to present Hegelian political thought through the prism of its own historical moment  taking the common difficulties that all of us experience in expressing universal ideas through singular experiences  Thus  I would like to note that although Hegel thought of the State from the perspective of the universal concrete  his Prussian gaze is guided by his concern for German unity  The article is divided into two sections  The first provides an exposition of the thinker s philosophical content  whereas the second seeks to carry out a systematic study of his political thought  based on his  Philosophy of Law  This systematization is understandable since the present text was initially a part of my Master s Thesis in which I related Hegel and Marx s thought in the 1843 period  as expressed in the latter s  Critique of Hegel s Philosophy of Law  Lastly  in conclusion  I argue that notwithstanding the relevance of Marx s set of criticisms  Hegelian thought seems not only to provide a portrait of the modern State but also the contemporary one  particularly that of the last 30 years  a period in which legislative power has lost its legislative role  increasingly substituted by the executive which in turn has been confronted by the task of increasing the universality within its particularities
