This article focuses on business relations and investments involving China and Latin America during the decade of the 2000s  There are three major interpretations  different yet interconnected  on this set of relations  According to the first one  Latin America  a region with abundant natural resources  exports primary products to a China in expansion that is experiencing a shortage of the latter  Close to this interpretation is also another one  advocated by prominent members of government  which asserts that economic relations between China and Latin America are fundamentally complementary and have a positive effect on both  In contrast  other observers have emphasized that what is seen as complementarity is in truth little more than a new form of Latin American dependence  These authors argue that  notwithstanding the rapid expansion of businesses and investments bringing short term benefits to both countries  the nature of these relations based on commodities actually reinforces dysfunctional standards of Latin American development which many countries within the region rejected some time ago and from which they have been trying to free themselves for a period now spanning more than half a century  Taking this discussion as our reference point  we present a general view of trade and investment relations between China and Latin America  highlighting the important role played by Chinese demand for Latin American commodities  This is followed by a description of different interpretations on what guides this commercial relationship as well as what consequences it may produce  We conclude by exploring the implications of our findings with regard to the notion that China provides the sole model for domestic and international political economy
