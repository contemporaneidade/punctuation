The objective of this work is to present and discuss the difficulties involved in the attempt to construct a sociological explanation of the idea of fair play   especially in sports  How is it possible that sports such as rugby and football  so different in terms of their rule for bodily contact  can draw upon the same principle to resolve problems not covered in their own rules  Social figurations as distinct as those established in badminton or in boxing  either in official or non official situations  also require the same virtue  In sum  what is the sociological explanation for the universality of fair play  In this work we try to show how an answer to these questions requires a debate on the foundations of the sociological theory and equally points to the necessity to develop the foundations of a sociology of morality
