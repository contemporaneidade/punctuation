Alternative conflict resolution based on forms of conciliation have been identified as a possible response to problems of access to courts deriving from the numbers  costs and length of proceedings in the Brazilian s judicial system  This paper focuses on these alternative forms of justice  regarding domestic violence matters  Using ethnographic methods of studies at Women s Police Stations and at Small Claim Courts  the main argument is that the forms of conciliation can be very different  specifically  in these two institutions of the judicial system  The contrasts between moral values and the simbols used differently by these two institutions offer some elements for us to understand the context in which was created the Law called Maria da Penha  sanctioned on August 17th of 2006  After this Law  cases of domestic violence against women were excluded from Small Claim Courts in Brazil
