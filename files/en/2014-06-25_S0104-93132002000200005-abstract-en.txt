How should one analyze the descendants of the nobility in France  This ancient group has been invented and re invented many times along its history  The Constitution suppressed it  then later on it was quite visibly rehabilitated  and it is always becoming disaggregated  in France as well as in other countries  How should one approach both this group s extreme diversity and its relative unity  which also have to be questioned as to their fictitiousness  Maybe the dense relationships and exchanges of all sorts between the descendants of the nobility contribute to the maintenance of some form of cohesion more than the symbolic resources they have in common  But this cohesion is becoming ever more difficult  At the present moment of the research  it seems that the descendants of the nobility cannot be analyzed neither as a body nor as a relative group  shy  even though these interpretations deserve attention  shy  but rather as a space  as long as the dynamism and the processes that crosscut it are analyzed as well
