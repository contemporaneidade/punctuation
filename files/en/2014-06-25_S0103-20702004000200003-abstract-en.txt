Wolfgang Streeck convincingly argues  in an influential paperpublished in 1997  that economic performance in market societiesis enhanced when the rational  voluntaristic choices of actorsare constrained by a variety of normative and institutionalconstraints  This paper offers three modifications of this centralDurkheimian thesis   1  the meaning of  good performance  ofan economic system differs among class actors in a market economy 2  the level of institutional constraint that is optimal for good economic performance  in the interests of capitalistsis generally lower than the level of constraints that is optimalfor workers  and  3  institutional constraints on voluntaryrational choice   even those optimal for capitalists   alsomay have dynamic effects on the balance of power among socialforces which could lead capitalists to prefer suboptimal constraintsfrom the point of view of  economic performance
