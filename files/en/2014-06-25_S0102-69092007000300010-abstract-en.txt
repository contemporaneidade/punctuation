In this article I want to explore the possibiltity  comparing certain continuities in both our political cultures  To do so  I have choosen two concepts which I consider to be important for understanding the differences between our countries  The first is in Portuguese compromisso  in Dutch compromis  With us it is the keyword in our system of institutionalized negotiations and an expression of our sociabilty  In Brazil the word is much more colloquial and individual  The second term is conscience  in Holland we speak of a clean conscience  while the Brazilian politician uses a quiet conscience  consci ncia tranq ila  With us it is a conscience without any stain before God and as to one s own individual principles  In Brazil it is much more an expression of embeddedness in the web of social relations
