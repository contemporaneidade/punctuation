This article presents complex systems simulation as a new method for the study the electoral behavior  assuming that social interactions are the key for each voter s decision  Insofar as public opinion polls uses information limited to the moment the interview is conducted  they cannot forecast changes overtime in each voter s choice that may be caused by interactions with the media or others voters  In contrast  the electoral simulator shows to be an interesting tool for electoral analysis because it introduces such interactions as premises  In this article  we present the theoretical model of the simulator  followed by simulations made for the 2002 and 2004 elections in Brazil
