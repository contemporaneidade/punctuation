In general terms  Brazilian historiography that analyzes the Estado Novo takes the latter s centralizing  nationalist and authoritarian character as its point of departure  constrasting these traits with the federalism that was in vigor until 1930 and was recovered  if only partially  in 1934  In a similar sense  the very intellectuals who were linked to the regime presented it as the form that was most adequate to our reality and most appropriate for the construction of national unity  in opposition to the private interests of the states and their local elites  It this study we attempt to demonstrate the syncretic nature of this new State  on the one hand  it imposed limits on states  autonomy and the power of their elites  but on the other  it was obliged to make a number of concessions and political agreements with these groups  in order to guarantee the order and national unity that were desired  Initially  we use intellectuals  discourse as the basis for an analysis of how the Estado Novo sought to legitimate itself to Brazilian society  next  we use the case of the Rio Grande do Sul interventors to discuss the regime s political practice and its need for cooptation and reconciliation with oligarchic interests
