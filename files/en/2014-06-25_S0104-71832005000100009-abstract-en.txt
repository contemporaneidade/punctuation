This article deals with the concept of heritage present in the public policies of cultural  artistic and historical heritage preservation  aiming to widen the apprehension of the concept  Bringing examples from my fieldwork in Venezianos Lane  in Porto Alegre  my purpose in this article is to analise the attribution of values to specific buildings  objects or processes as a way to produce new meanings within the different contexts in which it occurs  observing specially the construction of signification from the point of view of familiar heritage  heritage objects seen as sacred properties and the dimension of power involved in such process  Considering the ressignifications which resulted from the heritage acknoledgement  I analise the different categories perceived by the city inhabitants who are involved with the heritage  not in a passive way  but owning the capacity to construct new significances and to give meaning to the world around them  I try to underline the symbolic dimension present in this process in which the property acquires a meaning and comes to be considered heritage
