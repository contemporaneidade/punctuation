In this article we compare the external activities carried out by two subnational actors of different governmental levels  the Municipality of Porto Alegre  local government  and the State of Rio Grande do Sul  regional government  These two actors have developed external activities that are both relevant and pioneering in the Brazilian context  A description and a comparison of the institutional dimension  paradiplomatic structure  and the substantial dimension  agenda and instruments  of these two subnational governments form the core of this article  Based on the analysis of these two cases  our aim is to contribute to a more specific conceptualization of local and regional governments as international actors  Both can be considered as mixed actors  in part bound to the sovereignty they share with other levels of government over the territory they govern  in part freer than central governments as concerns their foreign policy options  sometimes acting in similar ways to non state actors  Our initial questions refer to how these two actors conjugate characteristics of sovereignty bound and sovereignty free actors and whether there are relevant differences between the external activities they carry out
