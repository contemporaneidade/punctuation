This ethographic study about the  rachas  of motos and cars is grounded around the question  if and in how far the acceleration of motors could serve as a methaphor for the acceleration of fluid  flexible and undetermined par courses of life in the context of  surmodern  societies  The objective is first to understand the significations given to the experiences of speed and of the risks implied  in order to analyse then the relationship between the youth s risk conduct and the rites of passage  We will discuss the potentialities and limits of comprehending the  rachas  on one side as an individualised form of a passage ritual and on the other side as a ludicrous expression of play and joy  Thus we could interpret the  rachas  like other varieties of youth culture as a language of singularisation and affiliation emphasized by practices of traditional hegemonic masculinity
