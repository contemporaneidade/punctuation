Drawing on the interplay of gender  ageing  and sexuality  the aim of this essay is twofold  On the one hand  to describe what we are calling the process of  eroticization of old age  and to explore through content analysis of the gerontological discourse how gender differences are dissolved in the attempt to demonstrate that the decrease in sexual activity in old age is replaced by a unique and intense sexual pleasure  On the other hand  to analyze  based on ethnographical accounts on elderly groups and associations  as senior citizen clubs and retirees organizations  the way in which these discourses on the ageing body and sexuality are differently perceived and evaluated by older men and women  The essay is therefore an attempt to present the difficulties faced by contemporary gerontology in order to promote eroticism in old age as well as an inseparable relationship between sexual pleasure and health
