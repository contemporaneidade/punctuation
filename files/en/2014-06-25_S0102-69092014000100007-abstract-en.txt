The idea that race based affirmative action is a multiculturalist policy is current in public debates and academic literature on affirmative action in Brazil  In this article  the authors analyze how this subject is addressed by major contributors to the theories of multiculturalism and communitarianism in order to show that the connection between race based affirmative action and those theories is far from automatic  In fact  despite a fair amount of disagreement about the value and justification of race based affirmative action  most authors see this kind of policy as rather assimilationist than favoring the expression of cultural difference  In sum  by misinterpreting the theory and practice of race based affirmative action  some Brazilian scholars and publicists contribute to distort the public debate on such important issue
