The article deals with Andr  Gorz s formulations on immaterial labor  His analysis of contemporary capitalism is based on a model formed by the categories of knowledge  labor  and capital  being knowledge the main productive force  The article compares this model to a former one  which was made by the categories of labor  value  and capital  in which labor was the main productive force  It then stresses that the difference between them is the replacement of labor by knowledge  In a knowledge economy  as that of the first model  the productivity of activities cannot be measured by labor time as in classic capitalism  besides  most of these activities are dependent upon practical knowledge  savoir faire  not prompted to be codified and appropriated privately  The thesis defended here is then that the main event behind this change from one model to the other is the dilution of labor time as a criterion to measure productivity  and it affects the value theory and therefore the base for calculating equivalences by capitalism  This is  according to Gorz  the main cause of the crisis of capitalism and of wage labor as the criterion for the attribution of rights  and this is also a sufficient motive for him to move in defense of unconditional income transfer to people
