The essay is primarily concerned with examining the methodological aspects of Benjamin s distinct idea of materialist historiography  which I would call a critique of culture  Kulturkritik  By means of the notion of Kulturkritik  I want to differentiate Benjamin s account from a  theory  of culture and to underline Benjamin s critical concern with the concept of  culture  In doing so  I aim to draw out its methodological imperatives for examining modernity as the spectacle  Furthermore  I also argue that Benjamin s critique of culture differs in significant ways from the Ideologiekritik developed by the early members of the Institut f r Sozialforschung
