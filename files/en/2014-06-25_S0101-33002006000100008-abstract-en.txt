There are two relevant differences between the pragmatism of Charles S  Peirce  William James and John Dewey and Richard Rorty s neopragmatism  Firstly  pragmatism is philosophically connected to realism while Rorty s neopragmatism is deeply anti realistic  Secondly  Rorty undermines the role experience plays on pragmatism by attaching an overwhelming theoretical value to the concept of language  Given these two main differences of approach  this paper questions the supposed continuity between the features that define original pragmatism and Rorty s neopragmatism
