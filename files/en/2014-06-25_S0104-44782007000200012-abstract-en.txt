This article presents a sketch of the debate between Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser over the notion of recognition  seeking specifically to understand some of the aspects that run through the Habermasian project of critical theory  If at a first glimpse  Honneth 39 s proposal  a theory of justice based on the notion of self fulfillment  and that of Fraser  based on the principle of parity of participation  appear to be unreconcilable  some common elements can be identified when we keep the background in which these theories operate in mind  We believe that the possible production of a model of recognition that is capable of combining Fraser 39 s and Honneth 39 s proposals depends upon making explicit some of the Habermasian premises that remain implicit within the perspectives we are analyzing here  This article sketches out comparisons and approximations between the three authors with particular regard to three aspects  the importance of ordinary interaction  the material dimension of social struggles and the relationships between law and morality
