Our paper discusses the role of the Civil Police within a democratic scenario in which citizenship is supposed to be completely institutionalized  For these purposes  we use quantitative and qualitative data on 235 different Brazilian police stations  collected as part of the Third  Week of Visits to Police Stations   2009  and international research that seeks to engage citizens  as potential users  to evaluate the way police stations deal with the public and the transparency of the services they offer  We seek to relate theoretical definitions of solidarity and justice to particular perceptions of citizenship that can be inferred from the evaluations that were carried out  We thereby structure the following article into three sections  including introduction and conclusion  The first section explains the  Week of Visits to Police Stations  in its different dimensions  The second contextualizes the concepts through which we plan to analyze Brazilian Civil Police actions  that is  civil citizenship and its deficits  The third section discusses how individuals represent the practices they observe in police stations and questions the extent to which these representations converge with the concept of  citizenship deficit  introduced in the previous section  Finally  we present some notes on how the quality of public services provided through police stations can help us understand how in Brazil it is hard to make ideals of justice and solidarity compatible  from a universal perspective  Our results indicate that the attention police stations provide is inadequate and therefore does not mesh with the  principles of justice and solidarity  that give shape to the notion of citizenship itself
