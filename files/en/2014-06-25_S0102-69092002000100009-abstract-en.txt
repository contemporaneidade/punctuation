This paper presents the debate about factory modernisation effects on worker s attitudes to the employer and the union  It results from a study drawn on a research at Brazilian White Goods industry during the 1990s  Some commentators have suggested that employers who modernise their factory will become dependent on the skills and attitudes of their employees  Others suggest that workers in modernised firms will be persuaded to go  beyond contract  due to the emergence of a strong and direct form of attachment to their employer  Moreover  it is uncertain what effect this may have on workers  attitudes to their union  While the results are influenced by the Brazilian context they do raise questions about the attitudinal and behavioural underpinnings of modernisation in any environment
