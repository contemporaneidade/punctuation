This article is written in three parts and a conclusion  In the first part  a reflection on the state of the art thoughts about the center periphery ideas is developed  The second part shows how these thoughts could be applied in understanding regional integration processes in general and within the European Union in particular  The third part focuses on the multilevel governance issues and proposes an analysis of the French and German sub national units at the European Union  As a political process  regional integration is far from bringing only benefits to the parts involved in it  The disparities emerge in multiple levels and they are not confined to national borders  The center periphery dichotomy is a fact in geo economical terms  although not in accordance with ideological conceptions as those set up by Prebisch  In understanding integration processes  the multilevel governance perspective seems to be a more adequate point of view  from which one cannot avoid investigating the role of sub national units
