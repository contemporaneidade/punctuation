This article seeks an understanding of several aspects of the disputes and conflicts that emerge around the implementation of a Nature Reserve or Reserva Biol gica  a conservation unit that is characterized by its particular restrictions on human presence  at Aventureiro Beach  on Ilha Grande  an island in the state of Rio de Janeiro  Our analytical perspective is based on the notion of the construction of a symbolic world focused on urban centers   the metropoles of nation states   which runs through the  national  space at all levels  represented in particular  by Law and legislation  The question of belief is seen as a basis for the legitimation of this new juridical order and of the actions of specific agents in the social world  Thus  emphasis is given to the influence of a specific life style shared by urban groups that tend to classify both  nature  and populations they consider  traditional  as  others   exotic  vis vis their urban environment  This brings us to the assumption that the Brazilian State  responsible for environmental tutelage  plays a similar role with regard to the populations that live within these conservation units  reserving for them a different type of citizenship  one in which a series of particular rights and restrictions create a particular social configuration  Through this case  it becomes possible to observe disputes regarding the legitimation of territories instituted by the State and those that have been shaped by local collective action
