In this article  I use bibliographical sources and testimonies to analyse the reception of Fanon by the Brazilian intellectual milieu  as well as his influence upon the formation of black identities  As I observe a lukewarm reception I argue it was due to three factors  First  the specificity of the Latin American left in the 1960 s  second  a national and racial makeup totally opposed to racial conflicts  and third the small number of black professors and researchers at Brazilian universities who focus on the formation of black identity or the affirmation of racially oppressed subjects
