The goal is to discuss the public perception regarding the role of the judiciary in the political electoral process and the consequences of this perception to the electoral governance  We explore the Brazilian 2010 elections and the episode of the  clean slate law  Unlike most current studies that focus on perception of the judiciary as a single institution we discuss the specificity of electoral justice as a political power and a public service provider   considering that the electoral judiciary operates  not only resolving electoral disputes but organizing and conducting the electoral process  We add new empirical evidence to an old question  do Brazilians trust or distrust the judiciary  Our argument is that when it comes to the organization and supervision of elections  Brazilians are confident in the judiciary as a guarantor of the fairness of the electoral process  But when it comes to conflict resolution  Brazilians tend to distrust the judiciary   slow  expensive and difficult to use  The educational level is decisive for this perception   the higher the educational level  the more favorable view of the judiciary  The basis for our discussion is given by the results of a survey conducted by FGV Law School a week after the second round of 2010 elections
