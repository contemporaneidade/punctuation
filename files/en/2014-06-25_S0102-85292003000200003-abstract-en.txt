This article responds to the variety of early attempts to interpret the broader significance of the violence of September 11  2001  Its central argument concerns the grounds for political judgement  It reads a variety of current interpretations of contemporary forms of violence partly in relation to claims about a Weberian politics of responsibility and partly in relation to structural tensions between principles of multilateralism and unilateralism  Neither multilateralism nor unilateralism  the article suggests  is sufficient to engage the questions about legitimate authority and violence to which September 11  2001 at least brought greater clarity  It concludes with a brief allusion to the increasing difficulty of drawing lines  not only lines between the civilized and the barbarian but also the physical lines that have been used to create a modern system of states  in many contexts  but this is a difficulty that is at the root of more serious problems involved in the formation of modern political judgment
