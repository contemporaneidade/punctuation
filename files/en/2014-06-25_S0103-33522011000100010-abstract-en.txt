The publication of Michel Foucault s lectures at the Coll ge de France in the late 1970s has provided new insight into crucial developments in his late work  including the return to an analysis of the state and the introduction of biopolitics as a central theme  According to one dominant interpretation  these shifts did not entail a fundamental methodological break  the approach Foucault developed in his work on knowledge power was simply applied to new objects  The present article argues that this reading   which is colored by the overwhelming privilege afforded to Discipline and punish in secondary literature   obscures an important modification in Foucault s method and diagnostic style that occurred between the introduction of biopolitics in 1976  in Society must be defended  and the lectures of 1978  Security  territory  population  and 1979  Birth of biopolitics  Foucault s initial analysis of biopolitics was couched in surprisingly epochal and totalizing claims about the characteristic forms of power in modernity  The later lectures  by contrast  suggest what I propose to call a  topological  analysis that examines the  patterns of correlation  in which heterogeneous elements   techniques  material forms  institutional structures and technologies of power   are configured  as well as the redeployments through which these patterns are transformed  I also indicate how attention to the topological dimension of Foucault s analysis might change our understanding of key themes in his late work  biopolitics  the analysis of thinking  and the concept of governmentality
