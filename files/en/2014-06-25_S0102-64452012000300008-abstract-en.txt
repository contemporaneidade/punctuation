The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of Constitutional Amendment 29  EC n 29  of 2000  on the decisions of state governors related to the allocation of funds for the health sector  aiming at identifying its conditioning factors  The results of the adjusted model showed that the variable amendment indicating the passing of EC n  29 was highly significant  confirming that its passing induced governors to raise the revenue percentage invested in the health sector  Among context related variables  just the net per capita revenue and the ideological profile of the governor s party were significant  However  the overall results allow to state that such variables only marginally condition the substantial effect of the Amendment on the states  What can be concluded is that the introduction of a rule such as EC n  29 was capable of inducing governors to adopt behaviors despite the context related variables considered herein
