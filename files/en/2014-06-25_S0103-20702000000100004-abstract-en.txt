The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into the history of the micareta in Brazil  from its origin as a mi car me  mid lent celebration  to its current expression  Although this research is in part a synthesis of the rare publications on the subject  most of the data comes from extensive historical archive research  carried out mainly in the Brazilian national and local press  The micareta is an old festival  started in 1908  and its history is closely linked to the carnival in Salvador  It resulted from an evolution of the trio el trico and from the Bahian trio bands  Tied in with the successive waves of expansion of the micareta throughout Brazil  five distinct developmental stages are discussed  Their salient features reflect the gradual commercialization of the micareta
