The question that I address in this article is the following  how does one engage in contemporary theoretical debates departing from studies of the so called Brazilian social thought  In order to answer this question  I argue that it is necessary to articulate Brazilian social thought scholarship to current debates which criticize eurocentrism and sustain the need for alternative discourses from the Global South as well  I also argue that it is important to put the history of Brazilian social thought into the wider context of a transnational history of the peripheral thought  I analyze Brazilian sociologist Guerreiro Ramos as a case study in order to expand on this thread
