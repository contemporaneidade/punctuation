The main objective of this article is to examine the recent debates about the factors that explain democratic stability in Brazil  Based upon the concept of political socialization it analyses the impact of elections on the strengthening of democracy and the importance of norms and values for the future of democracy  We think that presidential elections in the Brazilian case could be characterized as an important moment in the political socialization process  To test this proposition we use the data from the Brazilian Electoral Study  ESEB  conducted in 2002  2006 and 2010  It is analyzed if age generates differences in the values and attitudes manifested by people  with more democratic experience leading  to the materialization of a political culture congruent with democracy  or if they are defined by the electoral context  analyzing the dimensions dividing population by cohorts by age  and by electoral choice in each turnout  We conclude that political culture has changed to support more democratic values  but the contradictions remaining indicates a hybrid culture that does not favor a poliarchic representative democracy
