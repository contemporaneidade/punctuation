The main argument of this paper is that the process of interaction between Ukraine and Russia generates a social identity of enmity  which is the source of the conflict of interests between the two countries  In order to defend the argument  a theoretical model is proposed based on the importance of ideas to the constitution of interests and on the belief that interests are determined by identities  The next task is to demonstrate why the identity between the two countries is one of enmity  The reaction of both countries towards NATO expansion is used to illustrate the consequences of enmity  Because identities determine interests  the relationship between friend States involves common interests and between foes divergent interests  So the perception of a threat is shared by friends while between enemies the friend of one becomes the enemy of the other  That is why Ukraine cooperates with NATO and Russia does not accept its expansion  In order to avoid that the conflicts between Ukraine and Russia become a threat to Europe s security  it s necessary to change the identity constructed in through their interaction
