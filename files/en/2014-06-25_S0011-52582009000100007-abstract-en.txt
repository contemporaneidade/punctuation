This article discusses the right to health as provided by the Brazilian Constitution in light of the increasing number of court rulings that order government to supply health products and services that have not been incorporated into public policies by other means  Using the Constitution s concept of health as the point of departure  authors demonstrate that guaranteeing the right to health requires more comprehensive social and economic policies  They argue that scarcity of resources places a limit on the formulation of public policies and that equity should be the underlying principle for orienting resource allocation  The article contends that the interpretation of the right to health as the individual right to unlimited care  the predominant position in the Brazilian Judiciary  is sustained to the detriment of the Constitutional principles of equity and universality  and that this interpretation results in a reversal in the primary objectives of the Unified National Health System  SUS  transforming it into an instrument for the perpetuation of the country s persistently daunting health inequities
