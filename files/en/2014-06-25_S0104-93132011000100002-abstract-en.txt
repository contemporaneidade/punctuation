This paper examines the establishment of offices of the Smithsonian Institute of Social Anthropology  ISA  in Mexico and Brazil  The Smithsonian s presence depended on diplomatic agreements that required acceptance from the host countries  The article analyzes written documents such as interviews and institutional records to explore the relationship between the discourses and practices involved in the anthropological contribution to the US war effort  This analysis presumes a basic understanding of concepts used at the time  such as  applied anthropology   area studies  and  community studies  as well as definitions specifically used by the Smithsonian s anthropologists  such as  limited good  and  culture shock  The comparative method is relevant to understanding what happened in the two countries  In Mexico  political negotiations and other factors delayed its implantation  In Brazil the process involved inter institutional disputes  A closer look at these interactions leads to an analysis of the hierarchic interrelationships involved in the creation of the Institute
