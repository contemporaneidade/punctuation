This paper examines the apparent consensus on the bad quality of Brazilian Elementary and Secondary Education  It emphasizes five indispensable aspects of the subject that one should keep in mind in order to plan concrete actions to face the problems  They are  the existence of  educational islands  of good quality  usually neglected by public policies  the inefficacy of the multiple assessment tools  whose results are mainly used as an inspiration for fantastic newspapers  headlines  the inexistence of a more effective articulation among the different levels of education  the lack of autonomy of the schools as fundamental unities in the structure of the public education organization  and the need of explicit actions to improve the work conditions of teachers  An old and seminal article  An sio Teixeira  1953  is evoked by the author  in order to corroborate some of the aspects presented in the paper
