The author criticizes tlie theoretical endeavours of the British historian E  P  Thompson in order to give analytical consistency to the Marxist notion of  class consciousness  through ideas like  commom experiences  and  shared moral values  He maintains that the only way to demonstrate the analytical vitality of Marxism is by accepting the  vulgar Marxist  thesis of the determination of the superstructure by the economic structure  and by concentrating on the empirical problems that arise from the instrumental action of the actors on the  infrastructural  level
