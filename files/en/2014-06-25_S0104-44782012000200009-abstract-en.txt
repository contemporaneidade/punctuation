The present article examines different conceptions of the market  from the perspective of a New Economic Sociology  We focus in particular on different social relations of exchange  attempting to distinguish market  commercial  relations from others  In this regard  commercial exchanges are  as defined by classical and neoclassical economic theories among other elements  regulated by prices  characterized by their impersonality and potential anonymity  and   according to the recent terms that Andr  Orl an has used to refer to them  by the connected hypothesis of  nomenclature  and  perfect predictability  Exchanges that are not market  incorporated  on the other hand  include a wide spectrum of social relations involving material  emotional and intellectual interaction and exchange  yet do not include the previously mentioned elements  In other words  in addition to the non verifiability of the hypotheses of nomenclature and perfect predictability  they are relations which are not regulated by the price system and in which there are  or may be  emotional connections  Thus  the gift is an important case of non commercial exchange  In order to illustrate this variety of differences  we look at the case of organ donation  This example provides evidence of the problems brought about by positing all exchanges as pertaining to the sphere of commercial relations
