State and market are complementary institutions  The state is the major institution coordinating modern societies  it is the constitutional system and the organizations guaranteeing it  it is the main instrument through which democratic societies have been changing capitalism so as to achieve their own agreed political objectives  Markets are institutions based on competition which the state regulates so that they contribute to the coordination of the economy  While liberalism emerged in the 18th century to fight an autocratic state  since the 1980s neoliberalism  a major distortion of economic liberalism  became dominant and mounted a political assault to the state in the name of the market  but eventually also attacked the market  Neoclassical macroeconomics and public choice theory were the meta ideologies that gave to this assault a  scientific  and mathematical allure
