For two centuries historiography and the novel have been developing in competition with one another in many respects  At the same time  they are both compelled to confirm the narrated event in a more detailed manner than before  The reasons for this lie in the fact that the educational advantage of the author over the reader is diminishing  Furthermore  as soon as the responsibility for the course of history is no longer attributed to individuals but rather to collective or impersonal historic forces  new patterns of representation become necessary for the historiographer and the novelist alike  They have responded to this emerging crisis of narration in various ways  by means of specialization  through pluralization of perspective  through description of structure rather than narration of events  and finally  through a radical avowal of the subjective judgment of the depicted events  The portion that any historiography shares with fiction as well as the present  and future   oriented character of history represented in the novel are thus legitimated
