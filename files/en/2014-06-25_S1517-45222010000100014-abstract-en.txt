This article analyzes the representation of the feeling of insecurity in the face of crime  based on the comparative study of two communities in Portugal  with different models of sociability   concelho de M rtola and linha de Sintra  concelho de M rtola  eroded by a continuous demographic desertification  and linha de Sintra in increasing urban and demographic expansion  The paper interprets the interviews as a result of the influence of the signs and mechanisms that define modernity  and the socializing effect of the great paradigms that characterize life in contemporary societies  Normativity and rupture in face of the status quo appear constantly throughout the article  There is no feeling of insecurity  The individuals have many ways to express the apprehension that results from the intersection of variables such as  the dominant type of solidarity in the community or place of residence  residential proximity to places marked by exclusion and socio cultural and economic asymmetries  and the experience of victimization  either direct or emotionally close  It appears that these variables influence the practices and representations that individuals create to define the agents and their motivation for deviant behavior  as well as the efficacy of the mechanisms of social control
