The fact that modernity  as a historical event  emerges with modern science and technique  shows all its virulence today  It is even possible to say that this modernity is so embedded in  technique  that it can be named and characterized as a  technical modernity  This article proposes that such a concept can be used to reveal the essence and to discuss the emergency of this modernity in order to evoke  on one hand  its processual and historical event and  on the other hand  its highly unstable and unpredictable degree  Giving its contingent character  the technique contributes to a deprivation of a rationality of ends predominance  something characteristic of the historical phase in which the capitalism appeared within a contingent rationality  This rationality reveals the Being scientifically and technically but without revealing an end to be reached that could give direction or even identify its limits  With no direction or limits  the technical modernity is developed rationally  lacking protection against irrational oscillations that progressively punish its route  The article presents the German national socialism  the Russian communism and the American democracy as three ideal types of the technical modernity  A comparative glance in the direction of this modernizing triad of the XXth century shows the indifference for values for the technical modernity at the same time that promotes the understanding of the contingent and irrational phenomena generated in this process
