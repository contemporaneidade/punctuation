Focussing on an analysis of the Kuna ritual iconography  this paper sets out to outline a theory of social memory based on images as well as on stories  The emergence of White Spirits in kuna shamanistic iconography refers to the long series of violent conflicts that have opposed Indians and Whites  However  once inserted in ritual tradition  stories of the past collapse  and condense in complex images  Two processes seem to be at work in the elaboration of these images  one tends to obliterate the external fact to insert it in an indigenous conceptual frame  the cosmology of the supernatural world  the other employs the ambiguities of cosmology to represent a salient aspect of the newcomers  The result is an elaborate  and ritually powerful   engram  of ritual tradition  and becomes a significant part of social memory
