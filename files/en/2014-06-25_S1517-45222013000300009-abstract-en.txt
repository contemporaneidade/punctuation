The importance of French sociological thought for the development of contemporary academic sociology is widely recognized  especially for the contributions of E  Durkheim and M  Mauss  but also of authors as C  L vi Strauss  G  Gurvitch  P  Bourdieu  A  Caill  among others  There is  however  an interesting fact  in spite of its prestige  the particular characteristics of the French sociology are unknown in the world of contemporary sociological theory  And  for being unaware of its characteristics  some authors try to define the French sociology within the British dualistic paradigm agency versus structure  Now  such demarcation constitutes an epistemological mistake that prevents the understanding that French sociology draws on another paradigm  the  effervescent  Durkheimian logic of social differentiation that is developed through the systematization of the notions of representation  symbolism and social totality  An important key for disclosing the French sociological thought  particularly its new theoretical formulation in the context of social individualization observed in modernity  is Mauss  systematization of studies on the gift  of the three obligations  to give  to receive and to reciprocate
