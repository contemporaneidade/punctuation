Over a period of more than fifty years of policies  programs  and theoretical debates  the theme of development remains persuasive in social sciences  Giving special attention to the anthropological reflection over this topic  this article analyzes the path from the beginning of the development anthropology to the post structuralist and post colonial critique as well as the emergence of a multidisciplinary perspective known as post development  Following the discussion over ideas of post development  we turn our focus to the recent association between this perspective and the critique of modernity through the notion of decolonization  Moreover  we examine which problems come up in the dialogue among interpretations over an issue that can reinvent and reconfigure itself in multiple theoretical possibilities
