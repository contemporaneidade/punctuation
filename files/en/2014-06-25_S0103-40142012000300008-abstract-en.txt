The aim of this paper is to offer a retranslation of a chant of the Arawet  originally translated and annotated by anthropologist Viveiros de Castro in Arawet  the cannibal gods  According to Castro  the  Song of the Chestnut Tree  the name he gave to the chant  illustrates the enunciative quotational complexity of the shamanistic chants of the Arawet  For Castro  these chants are  a song of songs  a polylogical speech of speeches  That is why we first analyze the chant s enunciative complexity and only afterwards provide a retranslation
