The present text analyzes study abroad on the part of professors who teach in Master s and Doctoral programs in Brazil  using information provided through the national curriculum bank  or Plataforma Lattes  maintained by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development   Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient fico e Tecnol gico  CNPq    for the year of 2006  This data is analyzed within the context of a discussion on the effects of the internationalization of experts in State management and the uses of  Applied Social Sciences  since the use of such expertise is related to the strategies mobilized by agents in disputes over positions of power and around definitions of  the State   politics  and  justice  This enables us to elaborate hypotheses on the relationship between the international circulation of Brazilian jurists and the import and export of institutional models  as well as their repercussions within national juridical and political space  The reconverting of agents previously devoted mainly to the  operational world  toward an academic career and intellectual production  through investment in doctoral degrees and studies abroad  may be analyzed as the search to internationalize and provide new bases for knowledge related to the State and management of political and juridical institutions Similarly  in the case of jurists  this process includes the intellectual bases for resistance to institututional models that identify a weakening of the premises of the Nation state
