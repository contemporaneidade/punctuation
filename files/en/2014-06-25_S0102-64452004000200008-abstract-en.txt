The social democratic state existing in advanced democracies is gradually changing into a republican state  The neo liberal wave failed because modern societies need a strong  not a weak state  A republican state is strong enough to protect the public patrimony from private capture  The republican state that is emerging is fiscally strong because it limits its debts  it is administratively strong because it is engaged in public management reform  and it is politically strong because citizens  politicians and civil servants know that the principles ruling politics are not the same that rule markets  A short survey of the literature on republicanism is undertaken to substantiate these claims
