This article presents the results of a comparative study on socio spatial structures in Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo in 2000  We drew on data from the national Demographic Census by weighted areas to construct the Erikson  Goldthorpe  and Portocarrero  EGP  classification and the International Socio Economic Index  ISEI  both widely used in social stratification studies  This information was then submitted to group analyses for the two cities  allowing comparison of the presence of social groups in each city  Next  using spatial statistics  we assessed the spatial distribution of the socio economic classes and the presence of social segregation in the two metropolitan areas  The results suggest the presence of strong similarity between the social structures in the two cities  also marked by similarly intense patterns of social segregation at the metropolitan level
