Based on the critical limitations that were pinpointed regarding the historical experience of the North South Cooperation   NSC  the main objective of this paper is to analyze some of the dilemmas that the current strategies of South South Cooperation  SSC  have to face  which were conceived and developed in countries such as Brazil  Mexico  India  China  Turkey or South Africa  The author defends the hypothesis that the differentiation between NSC and CSS is basically empiric  but that it can also be considered in the view of the multilateral legacy of activism in some of these countries and the new economic and political role they play in the international scenario  The argument is based on the fact that since they were and still are NSC beneficiaries  the aforementioned countries should be aware of the risks of reproducing a cooperation model that they have recently criticized  What is unique and special in the practices of the SSC in these countries  What are the risks that the SSC practices would show less solidarity than the promises announced by their leaders and political representatives
