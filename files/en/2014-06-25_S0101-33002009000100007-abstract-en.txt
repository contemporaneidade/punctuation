This article presents a critical assessment of the pioneering production of Marxist intellectuals who  in the 1970s  attempted to understand the paradoxes of S o Paulo s urban growth  More generally  these intellectuals also tried to sketch a critical theory about urbanization at the periphery of capitalism  Gathered around two institutions   Cebrap  Brazilian Center for Analysis and Planning  and FAU USP  School of Architecture at the University of Sao Paulo    they were compelled by the political urgency of that historical era  and informed by the increasing influence of Manuel Castells  structuralist framework  As a result  they understood the city as a space of collective consumption  and also of social struggle around the reproduction of the working classes  However  the empirical exploration of the city allowed some of them to finally see the urban realm not only as the locus but also as the form of capitalist expansion
