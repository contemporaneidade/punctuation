The main purpose of this article is to study the diplomatic relations between South Africa and Brazil in a historical perspective  Bilateral relations between the two countries can be divided into three distinct phases  The first one  dating from 1918 to 1947  had trade as its core element and provided an opportunity for mutual discoveries  The second phase  from 1947 to 1991  was characterized by the establishment of full diplomatic relations followed by a gradual decrease in intensity of official interchange  The third phase can best be described as one of rapprochement between Brasilia and Pretoria  a direct consequence of the end of apartheid   the single most important obstacle to successful relations in prior years  A dynamic renewal of Brazilian and South African relations is therefore taking place in close association with the process of South African democratization throughout the 1990s  creating the context for mutually beneficial strategic partnership
