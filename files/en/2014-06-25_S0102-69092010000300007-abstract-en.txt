In this article we discuss the centrality of the concept of experience in Axel Honneth and Andr  Gorz  Such centrality is not always explicit  but underlies within its theoretical formulations  In his recent book   Reification  Honneth starts off from his theory of recognition to propose a contemporary elaboration of the reification concept in the form of the oblivion of recognition  In Metamorphoses of work and The immaterial  Andr  Gorz adopts as his starting point the ideas of non economic rationality and general intellect  respectively  to postulate the existence of experiences of a utopian potential  In both thinkers  elements of Adorno s category of  not identical  are present  as well as intertwinements with the phenomenology of Heidegger and Sartre  Both authors postulate the problem of  experience  in critical theory debates
