During the FHC government there was an attempt to substitute the reactive Brazilian foreign policy agenda  dominated by the logic of autonomy via distance  by a new proactive international agenda  determined by the logic of autonomy through integration  According to this agenda  the country should increase its power over the control of its destiny and sort out its problems by actively adhering to the elaboration of norms and guidelines for the conduct of the administration of global order  However  this integration  adhesion and participation policy was not fully followed up by the taking of standpoints that implied practical responsibilities because of structural disabilities  The responsibilities would prepare both government and civil society for an international insertion at a higher level  in the post Cold War era  The gains achieved during the FHC terms in office were not sufficient to significantly alter the Brazilian position within the world context
