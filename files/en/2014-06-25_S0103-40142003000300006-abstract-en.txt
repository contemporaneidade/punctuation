UNLIKE numerous existing studies of excellent quality  this survey attempts to investigate not only domestic violence  as it is known  but also the various types of homicide   attempted or consummated   committed against women from all age groups  We investigated and endeavored to compare how this kind of crime was treated  1  by the media   in particular  1991 and 2000 newspapers  radio  and television  2  in police reports filed in 1998 at precincts of the city of S o Paulo  and 3  in judicial lawsuits  according to a representative sampling of the five jury courtrooms in the city of S o Paulo in 1997  We sought to learn how the media  so resistant at first  dealt with violence towards women at the onset of the 21st century  what the police reports recorded and how the murderers of women were sentenced  The complexity of our results reveals changes in certain segments and a simultaneous mechanism that feeds back and advances age old violence in gender based social relations  We conclude by propounding the implementation of transversal gender policy to counter this violence
