The article discusses the connections between media and definition of political preferences or  in other words  the action of the media in influencing public opinion  It starts with a critical analysis over the studies on media and elections in Brazil  focusing three topics  the assumption that the processes of communication occur in a unilateral and regulated form  projecting an electorate more homogeneous than it really is  the conception of the media as a monolithic block susceptible of being reduced to the major communication conglomerates  and the understanding of the relations between media and electorate on the basis of those two simplifying presuppositions  After such analysis  the authors propose some analytical paths for reaching a more complex and refined vision of the relationship between media  political preferences and vote  In this sense  they point to the need of taking into account the diversity of the social environment and the complexity of the communicative processes  in which governmental communication must be considered  as well as the dissonances within media vehicles  and the alternative circuits producing political meanings
