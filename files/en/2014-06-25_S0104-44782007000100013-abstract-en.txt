Through analysis of data produced by the World Values Surveys project  this paper attempts to identify the impact that the period in which democratic institutions have come to prevail has had on the younger sectors of the population  precisely those who have had their political socialization during this period  Beginning from the premise that the incorporation of political values is rooted primarily in the first two decades of an individual acute s life  we seek to verify the validity of the hypothesis that democratic institutions tend to favor the establishment of values that are consistent with and amenable to their consolidation and deepening  For these purposes  we have tested the association between the variable  age  and some measures of values and political attitudes that have been emphasized by different approaches to what has been called  the theory of political culture  The results obtained run counter to the aforementioned thesis  or do so at least in the Brazilian case  insofar as values that are significantly different according to age group have not been identified for those who underwent their political socialization under historically different institutional arrangements
