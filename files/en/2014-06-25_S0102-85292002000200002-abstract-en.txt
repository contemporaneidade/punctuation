Brazilian foreign policy has displayed both continuity and change with the restoration of democracy in 1985  While Brazil has significantly strengthened its normative commitment to promoting democracy  based on a principled defence of the national interest  its engagement for the defence of democracy abroad has been hemmed in by its traditional attachment to the principle of national sovereignty  Brazilian foreign policy has nevertheless significantly evolved since the return to civilian rule  Fernando Henrique Cardoso s presidential diplomacy has provided a decisive impetus for strengthening Brazil s normative commitment to democracy  both through the introduction of democracy clauses in regional institutions and its own bilateral relations  However  there exist an inherent tension between the dual objectives of Brazilian foreign policy  which generates ambiguity in the conduct of foreign policy  There exist multifaceted trade offs between the principles of democratic interference and national sovereignty  as well as between the twin goals of stability and democracy  This study explores this tension by assessing Brazil s efforts at promoting democracy abroad and its response to threats to democracy and flawed elections during the last decade  It examines ten cases where democracy was at risk  It argues the principled defence of the national interest  on which Brazilian democracy promotion rests  is unlikely to survive Cardoso s presidency  Brazil needs to successfully resolve the inherent tension between the principle of national sovereignty and its commitment to promoting and protecting democracy abroad  both to clarify its foreign policy objectives and strengthen regional collective action mechanisms
