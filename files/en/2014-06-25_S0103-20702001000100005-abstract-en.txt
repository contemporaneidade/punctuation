The idea that science is  value free  can be traced back to the emergence of the distinction between fact and value in the 17th century  It can be considered to have three components  impartiality  neutrality and autonomy  We show that important parts of these component ideas were developed and defended by Galileo  principally in his letters to Castelli and to Grand Duchess Cristina and in his books The Assayer and Two Chief World Systems  Galileo s argument for autonomy is particularly powerful and  although lacking the generality introduced in later arguments  since his principal concern was to win autonomy for science from the authority of the Church  it remains at the core of all subsequent defenses of the autonomy of science  This argument is based on three suppositions  that scientific understanding is subject to criteria that are independent of the Church s authority and of any value perspective  that scientists have cultivated the virtues of the  scientific ethos  and that  because they use different languages   the  two books  argument  there cannot be contradiction between properly made scientific judgments and declarations of the Church  Finally some limitations of Galileo s arguments are indicated but not developed
