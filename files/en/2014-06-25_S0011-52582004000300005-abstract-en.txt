This article makes a theoretical reconstruction of a model for instrumental reason in language  using the notion of rhetoric  It takes persuasive language to be constitutive of instrumental reason  and analyses the possibility of pictorial representation of the operation of reason by sketching out the quasi logical components of arguments made by actors in strategic discursive interaction  in cases collected from empirical contexts of the conflictive use of speech  The article closes with reflections on the consequences of its proposals for the theory of instrumental reason  and affirms that rhetoric is the place par excellence for political theory to operate the connection between molded intersubjective rationality and strategic action
