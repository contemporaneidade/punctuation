The tasting act is both cultural and natural  The natural bit has to do with the make up of what s on the end of your fork and what happens physiologically when food hits your tongue  We can subject the former to chemical analysis and we can learn about the latter through the findings of modern neurophysiology  The general form of these natural things is stable over time  The cultural bit has to do with expectations and understandings about how things should taste  with frameworks relating taste both to the nature of aliments and to bodily consequences  and with the available vocabularies for talking about them and describing them to others  such things are temporally and culturally variable
