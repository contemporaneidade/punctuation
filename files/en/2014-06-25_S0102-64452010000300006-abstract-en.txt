In the relations between society and the state  the two forms of politically organized societies   the nation and civil society   play a key role  as also do class coalitions and political pacts  The relation between both is dialectical  but  initially  the state exerts more influence on the society  as democratization takes place this relation gradually changes in favor of society  Despite the fact that politics  the art of governing the state  is subjected to economic and political constraints  it counts with a relative autonomy  It is not the state but politics that has relative autonomy  Whereas society and the economy are the realm of necessity  politics is the realm of men s will and freedom  The deterministic political theories that search to predict political behavior fail because they ignore this relative autonomy of politics  It is through politics  in the framework of the democratic state  that men and women build their state and their society
