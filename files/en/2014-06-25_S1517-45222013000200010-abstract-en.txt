Two questions underlie the argument in this article  to what extent Freyre takes up the task of deconstructing a conceptual framework that is perceived as perpetuating the image of incommensurability between the Brazilian societal experience and that of the  modern civilized societies  What place does the tropical environment occupy in this project  I examine three operational hypotheses  1  Freyre makes a conscious attempt to relativize the exclusive  epistemological  normative and aesthetic expressive  role claimed by societies traditionally regarded as models of modernity  2  since the beginning of his work  the tropics was a key part of such ambitious intellectual project  because of peculiarities that would work as catalysts for an innovative social experience non reproducible in hegemonic European societies  3  the ambitious Freyrean attempt to destabilize the epistemological centrality of  European modernity  results inadvertently frustrated  insofar as this very experience  and the kind of sociability deemed to be peculiar to it  is resumed as a pattern to assess the singularity of Brazilian modernity
