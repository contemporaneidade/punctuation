The article aims to discuss the notion of hegemony in the thought of Antonio Gramsci and of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe  pointing out the similarities and differences between both perspectives  The concept of hegemony arises within the Marxist tradition as a response to the new social configurations and was better developed by Gramsci  In the last decades  Laclau and Mouffe developed a new approach of hegemony  in which they expand the gramscian notion for thinking the social configuration of late capitalism and for observing how the hegemonics struggles grow in the new social space
