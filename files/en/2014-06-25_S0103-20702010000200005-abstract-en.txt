This article is based on my research with people  generally young  responsible for crimes against property over recent decades in Buenos Aires  The analysis emphasizes the different connections between crime  work  poverty and urban experience formed over this time period  I look to show that  far from being a  criminal underworld  with its own logic  the transformations in the illegalities under study are generally conditioned by two factors  transformations in the labour market and changes in the cultural experience of poverty  whose meaning is linked to the equally mutating place of consumption  Finally the city  the place where everything unfolds  is transformed at the same time as the urban experience of the subjects alters and interferes in the illegalities under study
