During the last decade Brazil has witnessed the expansion and differentiation of its financial field  with a major impact on society and the composition of its elites  I analyze this process based on data concerning the new players and the instruments they disseminate in companies and other organizations in Brazilian society  These include both financial instruments per se and organizational tools based on the same logic  I seek to demonstrate that the quest for legitimacy for new players and instruments has led to a new cultural judgment on what constitutes society s  general interest  which drastically constrains action by the different governments and partially explains the paradoxes faced by the Lula Administration in its first year
