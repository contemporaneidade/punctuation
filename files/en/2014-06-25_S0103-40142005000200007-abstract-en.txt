THE SOLUTION of the problems in the Amazon is not independent  but connected with other parts of Brazil and the world  The reduction of deforestation and fire in the Amazon depends on the development of appropriate agricultural activities in areas already deforested and that they have market  instead of the  sustainable  use of the forest and of diffuse rights  In that sense  an agricultural policy would have more positive effects than an environmental policy  which cannot be made in an isolated way of the other areas of the country  under the risk of transferring population contingents from other places  There is the need to elevate the productivity of the agricultural activities in the Amazon  to reduce the pressure over the natural resources under exhaustion risk  to motivate rational plantings of potential extractive resources  to substitute the imports of tropical products  rubber  oil palm  cocoa  etc  to improve the exchange relationship of Amazonian products versus those imported from the Manaus Free Zone  promote the reclamation of areas that should not have been deforested and promote the full potential use of the areas already deforested  among others
