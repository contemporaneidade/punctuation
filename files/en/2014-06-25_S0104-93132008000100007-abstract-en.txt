The Wari  speakers of a Txapakura language living in the west of Rond nia state  Brazil  have been in close contact with fundamentalist Protestant missionaries of the New Tribes Mission for five decades  Using myth as a comparative framework  this article looks to understand conversion to Christianity as a process of adopting the enemy s perspective  related to the Wari  attempt to stabilize their position as humans  It also aims to contribute to the contemporary debate between anthropologists and scholars of religion over the integrity of Christianity as it propagates around the world by showing that the dichotomy between continuity and rupture makes no sense to peoples   like the Wari  and other Amerindians   whose culture is reproduced through successive alterations involving the transformation into an other and the acquisition of this other perspective  The adoption of Christianity as something new and external does not contradict the assertion of a continuity between this religion and native culture
