This article uses panel survey data from Caxias do Sul  RS  and Juiz de Fora  MG  in 2002 to assess to what extent partisanship constitutes a stable and effective political orientation for Brazilian voters  The analysis in the article focuses on respondents who support the Workers  Party  The main question is whether party identification can actually be considered a cause of vote choice in the Brazilian multi party system  In order to answer this question  two competing perspectives are examined  The first perspective argues that  even though partisanship is restricted to a small proportion of the Brazilian electorate  it is a strong orientation among those voters who express it  The second perspective argues that partisanship is mostly an unstable orientation that acquires salience only during electoral periods  and due in large part to campaign effects and the influence of candidates  The results show that almost half of the party preferences that are reported in the electoral period are exclusively a result of the salience of the presidential election  and that partisan identification tends to disappear when the race is over  Moreover  unstable partisans tend to vote less frequently for their preferred party in elections than stable partisans  Finally  it is shown that unstable partisans tend to present lower levels of political involvement and sophistication than stable partisans
