In the critical theory of Frankfurt School  emancipation has been the ultimate normative criterion against which both the reconstruction of social theory and the analysis of specific social realities were evaluated  As in Habermas Theory of Communicative Action there was a certain restriction to the world of life  to the detriment of political administrative and economic subsystems  in his Theory of Recognition  Axel Honneth proposed to take up again the project of a critical theory to analyze all dimensions of social life in the light of ethical immanent criteria and having emancipation as its teleological horizon  In his book The right of freedom  outline of a democratic ethics  released in June of 2011  he develops a theory of justice that  unlike the tradition in which the author adheres to  sets freedom as the ethical criterion in various spheres of life  This paper analyzes the roots of that work inquiring how the issue of emancipation has been related to the ends of a theory of justice  Its attention is less focused on the actual content of the diagnosis of time and more to the methodological proposal for normative reconstruction as a tool for the analysis of society
