The argument of this paper is that the vocation of comparative studies is the search for generalizing causal inferences able to explain the formation  stability and change in political institutions  Initially  we tried to identify dilemmas in the institutional theory  located in the fragility of interpretations on institutions formation  as well as for the understanding of the conditions under which institutions appear to be able to cause the effects attributed to them  in the second section  we seek to show how the notion of comparison as a research strategy based on few cases  many variables  eventually reduces the potential for the construction of generalizing explanations  Finally  we sought to strengthen arguments for the incorporation of temporal intervals and sequences for comparative analysis
