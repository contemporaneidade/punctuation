In recent debates known as  the culture wars  Sokal and Bricmont have challenged what they call  intellectual fraud  perpetrated by social scientists philosophers cultural critics who mention science  or make use of scientific argument  in order to support relativistic stances  A paradigmatic example of  intellectual fraud  would be the statement that the number p is  socially constructed  Through a discussion of this example  the author proposes an alternative point of view based on what he calls a moderate version of relativism  This version relies on the notion that it is always possible to translate between distinct ontologies  thus guaranteeing intersubjectivity and  consequently  objectivity  Finally  he argues against Sokal and Bricmont s intent of imposing rules for the good usage of metaphors in the human sciences
