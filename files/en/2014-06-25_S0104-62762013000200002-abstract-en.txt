Why do nearby towns tend to have similar electoral results  We test here three possible explanations  social interactions between inhabitants of nearby towns  the concentration of campaign strategies in some areas to the detriment of other areas  and the socioeconomic similarities of nearby towns  Using data from the 2010 elections and spatial econometrics  we rejected the first hypothesis  we found some preliminary support for the second hypothesis  and we found unequivocal support for the third hypothesis  The data also show that Dilma Rousseff  inherited  Lula s electoral basis of support and that this is quite different from that of the PT  which remains an urban based party
