Our goal here is to analyze the construction of what we refer to as the  Mercosul model  that can be identified within Brazilian foreign politics  from the beginning of the 1990s through the second half of the decade of 2000  Starting from the premise that the positions that Brazil takes are relevant in defining the framework of integration processes  we suggest the hypothesis that it is Brazilian positions that limit the breadth of the bloc and  in particular  its depth  insofar as they undermine decision making processes  the legitimacy of the institutional mechanisms that have been put into place  the coordination of the expectations of different domestic actors and  most of all  the scope of the measures that have been proposed to solve or reduce current assymmetries between states  Brazilian positions have been based on the logic of intergovernability and have been more adapted to the expansion of the bloc than to intensifying it  This article looks at the formative aspects of standards for Brazil s foreign behavior  seeking to identify major tendencies in its actions within the bloc during the period analyzed  One of our major arguments refers to Mercosul s successive institutional crises  seeking to relate them to the structural limits of the model  compatible with formative elements of Brazilian foreign policy but still insufficient for sustaining a process of intensified integration
