The paper first suggests a shift from farming to agriculture generated by the advent of industrial capitalism  and its dominance on a world scale from the nineteenth century  and a second shift from the 1970s with the advent and trajectories of contemporary globalization  The paper then argues that debate of the  final   death of the peasantry  in the era of globalization is misconceived and anachronistic  and that the theorization of  small farmers  as petty commodity producers within capitalism  and subject to its tendency to class differentiation  provides a more satisfactory approach to agrarian questions today
