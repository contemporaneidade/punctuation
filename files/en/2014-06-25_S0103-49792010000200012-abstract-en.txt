This paper reviews the historical reasons for the emergence of the category of back of pasture  We made use of secondary data collected from government reports and obtained in interviews with technicians  pastoral communities and agents  The backs of pasture were just grazing areas not surrounded by Caatinga  used for communal grazing  This pattern of occupation that has developed throughout the Northeast semi arid region was gradually usurped in a process similar to the British enclosures  In Bahia  with the advances of capital over these areas from the 1970s  there were regional articulations and institutional support that stimulated various resistances   Back of pasture  came to denote not only the areas  but social groups that depended on them and therefore advocated them  The formerly only regional term Back of Pasture  became widespread throughout the state  especially after its quoting in the constitution of Bahia  Family ties in these communities also contributed to the resistance of this form of occupation
