This article highlights the contribution of Wilheim Dilthey  part of the so called German  romantic hermeneutics  movement  to contemporary human sciences  specially in relation to the search of the philosophical and epistemological foundations as a form of alternative scientific knowledge to   positivist  and   naturalist  knowledge  There are three main points  The first is the meaning of the terms   Verstehen   understanding  and   Hermeneutics  from Dilthey s perspective  The second refers to the main concepts of his theory such as  for example    internal and external experience    causality  and   understanding  identifying two phases in its comprehension of human action in which he passes from a stage marked by psychological comprehension to another  centred on a hermeneutic comprehension  In conclusion  we present some considerations on Dilthey s contribution to the social sciences and on Gadamer s central criticism of the way in which he sought objectivity for the human sciences  It is considered that the concept of experience  the concept of causality and the search of objectivity in the human sciences  in the terms expressed by Dilthey  posited various perspectives which have nourished the philosophical debate since the second half of the twentieth century  such as for example Gadamer and his philosophical hermeneutics  or more recent authors like Giddens  1977  and Souza Santos  1989  concerned with developing this methodological approach for the human sciences  specially in the sense of fostering the appearance of the fundamental conditions for a change in paradigms
