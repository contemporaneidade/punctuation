In this article I elaborate theoretical comments on the subject of corporeality and the new forms of experiencing the body that are present in contemporary times  On the basis of a research with a Brazilian men 39 s magazine  VIP Exame  which involved the analysis of issues of the magazine as well as an observation of the working process of the reporters and journalists  I focus my comments on the way the masculine body is treated by the magazine and how a discourse emerges on masculinity where attention to  good looks  becomes an important feature of a successful masculinity  On the basis of these observations I go on to discuss feminist and other theories of the subject  in order to understand how the reflexive monitoring of the body is increasingly important in the constitution of gender identities
