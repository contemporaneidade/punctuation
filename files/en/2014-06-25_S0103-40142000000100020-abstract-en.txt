IN HIS De Magistro Saint Augustine places prayer and song on a similar level  alongside the language immediately communicative functions  His considerations on prayer are grounded on the Christian habits of silent reading  prayer and meditation  those on song  on the equally innovating practice called jubilus  which is melody without words designed for the intensest and most joyous liturgical moments  Silent prayer and jubilus are recurring topics in patristic literature  but Augustine deals with them in an original way  drawing from the soundless words of prayer and the wordless sound of jubilus an inner discourse  addressed not to men but to God
