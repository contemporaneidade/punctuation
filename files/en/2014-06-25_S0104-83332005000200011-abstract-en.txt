Considering the relevance of Internet in the constitution of the transnational sex market  I analyze in this text  in an anthropological approach  how the images of South American women spread throughout the cyberspace participate in the alteration of the world s sexual tourism circuit  I argue that  while there is a close relationship between sexual tourism and inequality  poverty  even if extreme  does not warrant the  success  of a new center for sexual tourism  Given certain economic conditions  cultural aspects that express the intertwining of ethnic regional traits and styles of sexuality  operate as ways of attraction for the rise of new targets  First  I present the specificities of the virtual space analyzed as well as a characterization of the users  Afterwards  I describe the interactions propitiated by the site and its working code and  taking into account the concepts associated to different regions  I analyze the characteristics of the sketched sexual ethnic borders  Finally  I return to my initial argument  reflecting on how the processes of racialization that operate in this virtual space participate in the displacements in the world geography of asexual tourism
