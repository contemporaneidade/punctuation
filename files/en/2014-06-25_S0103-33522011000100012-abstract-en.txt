The studies of party politics in Europe  and particularly in France  have fallen into a certain analytic routine  One of the reasons for this is the neglect in studying organizations that do not fit in the typical models privileged by traditional approaches  Also important in this sense is the tendency in fashion towards outlining  amongst other things  the notion of cartelization  or the political combinations or coalitions between parties  Submitting these models to verification in base of empirical observation of the  atypical  party organizations  as well as working with the notion of institution in order to think party formations as living organisms  are  for instance  the ways through which one could take political parties not for what they should be  or are not  or even no longer are  but exactly for what they are
