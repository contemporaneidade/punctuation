This article proposes an interpretation of the ways by which the term assimilation was used in Brazil in three different periods  It also presents a reconceptualization of the term based on Remaking the American Mainstream  Assimilation and Contemporary Immigration  by Richard Alba and Victor Nee  published originally in 2003  The argument is that the new formulation proposed by these authors can contribute to a more precise understanding of the different trajectories in the incorporation of foreign immigrant groups in Brazilian society in the past and present
