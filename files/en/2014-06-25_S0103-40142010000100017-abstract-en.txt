One of the aims of energy policies is reducing CO2 emissions  In transports bio fuels are one of the alternatives  Brazil is the world leader in producing ethanol from sugar cane  Prejudice against imports of Brazilian ethanol in US and EU markets is unjustified  as it represents the best ecological balance and does not reduce production of basic food in Brazil  As to biodiesel on the basis of soybeans social and ecological reserves partly are in order  Regarding ethanol industrialized countries should not use exaggerated criteria as to sustainability of production as pretext for protecting their own producers from imports of cheaper Brazilian bio fuels
