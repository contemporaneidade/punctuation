This paper analyses trajectories of socialization in the candombl  of members of Salvador s lower classes  Firstly  it discusses the ways by which primary socialization within the family articulates with religious socialization  Then it turns to the question of understanding how relations with different classes of sacred entities may thicken or extend certain lines of relationship within the extended family  Analysis of the trajectories points to the significance of the neighborhood  bairro  as a main space of sociability for the urban poor  It indicates that informal relations with entities often precede the establishment of formal bonds with candombl  houses  developing itself in the everyday space of the family and the bairro before being formalized in the religious institution
