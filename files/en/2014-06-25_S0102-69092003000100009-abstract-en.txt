The article discusses the impasses and alternatives to political representation  taking as starting point the controversy about the concept of power  which occurred in the sixties and seventies in the Anglo Saxon political science and involved  notably  Robert Dahl  Bachrach   Baratz  and Steven Lukes  According to Lukes  the understanding of power must consider three dimensions   1  the aptness to take decisions or to veto them   2  the control over the agenda  that is  the determination of the questions that will be object of decisions  and  3  the aptness to nullify social conflict  by preventing individuals and social groups from taking consciousness of their true interests  Despite its problems  this formula is useful to think political representation  Predominant theories take only the most evident face of political representation into account  the choice of decision makers  But a representative democracy closer to the ideal of popular sovereignty would have to include a second dimension  shy  the formation of agenda  what is strongly influenced by mass media  Hence  it is necessary to understand mass media as also a sphere of political representation  And recognition of the third dimension implies the need of generating spaces where subaltern groups can autonomously formulate their interests  that is  a developed and plural civil society
