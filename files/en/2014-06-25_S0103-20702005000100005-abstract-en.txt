This paper suggests a historical analysis of the category  Latin American city  as a cultural construct  The central argument is that  during the period between the post war and the 1970 s  the idea of a Latin American city became a category of social thought  as part of the intellectual and political imagination in several regions of the continent  The text tries to rebuild the main conceptual and ideological turns  their political and institutional functions within the specific regional circumstances  The article suggests that this approach to the  Latin American city  category in its precise historical configuration may be a productive path for Latin American cultural studies
