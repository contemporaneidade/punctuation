In Brazil  the transition from the state of exception to the democratic rule of law contributed to significant changes in the design of policing  Among other changes  are included  external control of the police internal affairs  investigation and punishment for  bad cops  the involvement of the police and the population in community councils  seeking improvements to security issues  concerns by the police with a different treatment approaches for citizens and those who seek to provide the police complaints  investment in intellectual training in police academies  requirements for the Brazilian government to obey international agreements that establish the purpose of torture as a research method  This process has found  however  some obstacles and resistance  In this paper  results of a survey conducted between the years 1999 to 2007 the Unified Police Magistrate in Fortaleza  CE  presents some complaints involving military and civilian police in criminal acts punishable as disciplinary offenses  As a conclusion of the research  I argue that  because of the lack of dialogue and peaceful rules between police and civilians  police violence has compromised the expectations of the civilizing process that is exerted by the strengthening of the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force
