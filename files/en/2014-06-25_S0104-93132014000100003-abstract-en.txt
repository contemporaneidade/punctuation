In this article I argue that Cuban Creole forms of espiritismo wield a sophisticated cosmology of Self in which the human psyche and its surrounding universe of protective spirits are embedded in a relationship of mutual production  These Self related theorizations subvert linear readings of spirit identities as fragments of national imaginaries  suggesting instead the importance of a fluid  plastic cosmos in which spiritual form is contingent on cultural and personal repertoires  but also remains partly  other  to those Who apprehend it  thus retaining the capacity to transform them  This is explored both through a juxtaposition of anthropological and indigenous discourses on the psychology of spirits  and a look at more broad ranging instances of ontological plasticity
