This work proposes a reading of Nelson Rodrigues  dramaturgy having in mind some issues that permeate the theatrical field in the second half of the XX Century  the author s position in face of them and the theatrical project that he explains in his texts  Inside a cultural field marked by intense social and political fights  Nelson Rodrigues produces his plays focussing on theatre s purifying and redeeming functions  In opposition to a whole stream of political engaged theatre  the proposed dramaturgy is infested with intense characters  both in their expression and in their sexual repression  whose function would be to purge the audience  That kind of bet on a sense and value for the theatre occurs from some alliances  such as  for example  to Gilberto Freyre s Sociology  Reader and profound admirer of the sociologist  Nelson appropriates  for his theatrical project  various elements of the said sociology  such as excessive violence  physical  sexual and sensual  marks of hybris  as well as the analysis of imported civilization patterns  which also impose themselves by violent repression  The tension between elements of immoderation and of discipline generates a series of characters  situations and struggles  which permeate the works and may also be considered as elements of a strategic alliance
