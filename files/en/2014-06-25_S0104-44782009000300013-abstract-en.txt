The purpose of this article is to present results of our research on Brazilian political party websites  Through a mapping of international literature on this topic  we present a proposal for evaluation of the websites of major Brazilian political parties and a classification of the degree to which they use the Internet  Putting together a table that summarizes content analysis of the websites of 27 Brazilian political parties that were registered in the Electoral High Court  Tribunal Superior Eleitoral  TSE  during the first semester of 2008  before the beginning of the electoral period  we came to the conclusion that most Brazilian political parties do not use the internet enough  even when evaluated only through the strictly normative parameters of propitiating a more transparent and accountable  representative democracy  Furthermore  for the Brazilian case  a  normalization hypothesis  in which patterns of political competition that hold true in the  real world  would tend to reproduce themselves in the web cannot be proven  A third general conclusion we arrive at is that there is an association between political party characteristics and the way party websites are organized  although this association is not as close as that which the international literature has maintained
