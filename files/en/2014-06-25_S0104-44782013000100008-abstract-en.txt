This article revisits the process of certification of election results by the National Congress during the Brazilian First Republic  1894 1930  before the Electoral Code of 1932 was created  We analyzed data on electoral protests and counter protests submitted by political opponents to challenge electoral results of the Chamber of Deputies   unpublished sources available in Diaries and Annals of Deputies itself  Contrary to the widespread view in the literature we show that the practice kown as  degola   beheading  whereby electoral results were altered by Congress  was not usual  but restricted to critical years  during moment of political uncertainty at state level  In most cases the Chamber of Deputies ratified the decision taken at the subnational level  Thus  the Brazilian case alert us to the fact that the adoption of independent courts is not just a mere response of how to solve electoral disputes that occurred in the parliament during the certification process  This finding allows us to think about the introduction of Electoral Justice as part of a broader project of political reform  including resolution mechanisms for the administration of elections
