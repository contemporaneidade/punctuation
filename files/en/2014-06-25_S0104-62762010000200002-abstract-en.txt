The debate about the distancing between Lula and the Workers Party  PT  gained acceptance in the 2006 election  when the popularity of Lula and his government did not extend to the PT  as expected  For the first time the party did not improve performance in the voting for the Chamber of Deputies regarding the previous election  We analyzed the electoral bases of Lula and the PT in the last four elections for president and federal deputies  1994 2006  and we prove the distancing between them  We studied the spatial distribution of votes at the municipal level with maps  statistics and spatial regression  We identified the detachment of the candidate s and party s electoral territories every election  and the regressions measured the growing spatial temporal independence of the votings  the coefficient fell from 0 85 in 1994 to 0 15 in 2006  There was a process of geossocial distancing in the period 1994 to 2002  and a  divorce  between the electoral bases in 2006 when the territories seemed to be nearly unrelated to each other
