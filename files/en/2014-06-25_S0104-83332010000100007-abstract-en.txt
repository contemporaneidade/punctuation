Relying on gender studies and post structuralist cultural and political anthropology  we analyze information generated in group discussions and interviews with French youngsters from Grigny Center   on the outskirts of Paris  with a view to discussing elements  appearing in the discourse as  relevant  words  involved in the processes of constituting juvenile male identity in that particular context  We suggest that these relevant words define ways of being and living and of putting into practice masculinity  This discussion may assist in reflecting on the  problem  of poor urban youth in Brazil
