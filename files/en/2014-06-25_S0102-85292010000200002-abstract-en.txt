The familiar orthodoxy of liberal peacebuilding depends upon transplanting and exporting conditionality and dependency in order to cement a social contract between populations  their governments and the state  on which rests a legitimate and consensual liberal peace  What often emerges is a hybrid form of the liberal peace  subject to powerful local critiques  sometimes resistance  and to the perception that international peacebuilding is failing to live up to expectations  In Kantian terms  the problems that the liberal peace has faced  and the crisis that it is now in  can be termed  backsliding  It has been particularly notable that liberal peacebuilding has not been able to build united polities from territorial fragments in Kosovo  Bosnia  Afghanistan  Iraq  Sri Lanka  and even in Northern Ireland  where some or all if its elements are in development  This indicates a need for a reform of the liberal model for peace  or to establish a capacity for it to coexist with other alternatives  or to replace it  This article examines a range of issues inherent in the liberal peacebuilding paradigm  some causes of backsliding  and what might be done about them in terms of using peacebuilding to create a new social contract and to arrive at may well be a  liberal local hybrid  form of peace
