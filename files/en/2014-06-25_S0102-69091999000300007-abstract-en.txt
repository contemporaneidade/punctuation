The article analyses some of the views consolidated during the construction of political identities around the so called  new unionism  These views  which arose in the late seventies through the coming together of the social movement and academic debate  were characterised by the idea of a clean break between the past and present of the Brazilian trade union movement  thereby establishing a gulf between the new and the old trade unionism  Taking into account the development of  new unionism  and further studies on the Brazilian labour movement  the author points out the limits of this perspective based on a breach with the past  Moreover  he presents an alternative interpretation that emphasises the continuity of certain practices in the workers  organisational experiences  Through examples  the article argues that the  new unionism  can be seen as continuing long term traditions
