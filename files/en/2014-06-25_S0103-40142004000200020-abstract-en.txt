THIS ESSAY aims to draw a profile of Machado de Assis as a reader and critic of theatrical works  We begin by observing Assis in the theatrical milieu of the 1850s and 1860s  the time of the onslaught between the Romantic and Realist aesthetics in the stages of Rio de Janeiro  We then view his extensive production as journalist  when he distinguished himself as a drama critic and writer of feuilletons  and also his activity as censor of the Brazilian Drama Conservatoire  a post he held for a short period  By following Assis  intellectual journey during his literary youth  we have attempted to analyze  understand and explain his ideas toward the dramatic arts in general and the Brazilian theater in particular
