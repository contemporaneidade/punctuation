The French policy of  resettlement  of Algerian peasants  designed to undercut popular support for the nationalist war of liberation  1954 62  led to the displacement of one fourth of the indigenous population of Algeria in 1960  By disciplining space and rigidly reorganizing the life of the fellahin under the sign of the uniform  the French military hoped to tame a people  but it only completed what early colonial policy and the generalization of monetary exchanges had started  the  depeasantization  of agrarian communities stripped of the social and cultural means to make sense of their present and get hold of their future  War thus accomplished the latent intention of colonial policy  which is to disintegrate the indigenous social order in order to subordinate it  whether it be under the banner of segregation or assimilation  But imperial domination also produces a new type of subject containing within himself or herself the contradictions born of the clash of civilizations  the patterns of behavior and economic ethos imported by colonization coexist inside of the exiled Algerian peasant with those inherited from ancestral tradition  fostering antinomic conducts  expectations  and aspirations  This double sidedness of objective and subjective reality threatened to undermine the efforts to socialize agriculture after independence  as the logic of decolonization inclined the educated petty bourgeoisie of bureaucrats to magically deny the contradictions of reality as shameful ghosts of a dead colonial past
