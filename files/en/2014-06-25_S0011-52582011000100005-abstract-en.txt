Many scholars continue to ascribe a fundamental role to routine action in social theory and defend the continuing relevance of Bourdieu s concept of habitus  Meanwhile  the majority recognize the importance of reflexivity  In this article  Archer examines three versions of efforts to render these concepts mutually compatible   empirical combination   hybridization  and  theoretical and ontological reconciliation  In analytical terms  none of these versions is fully successful  The empirical argument is that the relevance of habitus began to decline in the late 20th century  in light of major structural changes in advanced capitalist democracies  In these circumstances  habitual forms have proven incapable of providing guidelines for people s lives  thus making reflexivity necessary  The article concludes with the argument that even the reproduction of one s birth history now constitutes a reflexive activity  and that the most favorable mode of its production  which the author refers to as  communicative reflexivity  is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain
