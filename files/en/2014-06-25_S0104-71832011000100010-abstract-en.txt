The objective of this paper is to explore the interrelations between genetic research with human populations  the political strategies of indigenous movements and processes of identity formation  In particular  it will analyse the social conditions that have resulted in the collaboration between the Uros  an indigenous group living on the floating islands of Lake Titicaca  Peru  and researchers of the Genographic project  The Uros  whose claims to a differentiated ethnic identity were highly contested within the local context  engaged with geneticists with the aim to obtain scientific support for this identity  This was part of their political strategies for their territorial rights  As such  this case offers new insights into the incorporation of genetic research within the conceptual politics waged around ethnic identities  as well as the articulation of genetic knowledge with pre existing registers to define such identities
