Abstract  We know that Brazilian citizens  just like those living in other democracies of the world  know very little about politics  We know less  however  about the consequences of political ignorance on the democratic process  Some scholars argue that the lack of political information has minimal effect of people s political attitudes and behaviors  Others  however  claim that the effects are substantial  In this paper  we examine this question using a survey experiment conducted in Brazil in 2004  Specifically  we explore how information about the federal government affects attitudes toward government spending and taxing policies  The experiment has a control group and a treatment group where subjects in the latter were provided political information before measuring their preferred level of government spending and taxing  Results indicate that those who received political information tended to prefer less government spending and taxing  as compared to those who did not receive any information  These results carry important implications for the democratic process because they indicate that a more knowledgeable Brazilian electorate would hold different political preferences
