Participatory institutions have been described as mitigating factors for traditional political inequalities  since they broaden the access of actors excluded from the formal system  However  they have also borne some criticism  with claims that social and political inequalities are reproduced within them  This paper describes an empirical research on inequalities within the national councils on public policies  For this purpose  we analyze survey data obtained from questionnaires applied to 767 board members from 21 different national councils and 3 national committees  Data analysis focused on inequalities among councilors as to income  education  gender  race ethnicity  region of residence and sector of representation  The study aimed at identifying if  regarding these six selected dimensions  the councils include actors traditionally excluded from the political process  The analysis revealed a complex context as to the existence of inequalities within the national councils  Through an aggregate view  the councilors  general profile indicates that in average they have both income and education levels substantially higher than the average population  There is  however  important variation between the profiles of board members from national councils of distinct areas of public policy  In some areas  councils present a plural composition  are more inclusive and create new opportunities for access to deliberative spaces
