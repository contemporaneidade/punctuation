The so called  elite theory  of which Robert Michels was one of the canonical authors  is a body of doctrine which aims to demonstrate the impossibility of a more democratic and egalitarian social order  It is thus an example of the  futility thesis  discussed by Albert Hirschman  which states that any attempt to change the world is useless  The article argues that  despite this  the  iron law of oligarchy  presented by Michels in 1911 may be appropriate for a reflection committed to the advancement of democracy  Instead of leading to the abandonment of the democratic ideal  it serves as a warning against bastardization of that ideal by the very institutions who claim to implement it  providing tools for a critical analysis of political representation
