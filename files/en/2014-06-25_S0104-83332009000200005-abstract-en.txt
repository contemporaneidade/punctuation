The English philosopher J  L  Austin s studies have contentious interpretations and appropriations  pointing out to the complexity of his texts and his always fertile contributions  One important set of these interpretations are body studies  these discuss the body as speech acts or the subjectivizing bodily process as performative  My interest is to approximate and to contrast three theoretical signs of those body interpretations and to discuss their theoretical consequences to language studies  in particular to the identity studies
