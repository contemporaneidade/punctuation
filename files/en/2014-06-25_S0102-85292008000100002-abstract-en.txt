In this paper  I  mainly  analyzed the inclusion of environmental budget in climate change models  Considering Kemfert  Lise and Tol  2004 s approach to show a formal model that puts together economic and climate issues  I analyzed the inclusion of environmental public spending and energy  I tried to show that countries  economic and physical structures establish different public spending  with different environmental impacts and consequences to another nations and that has strong influence on economic models  In relation to public spending  I considered  specifically  the Brazilian federal budget to Environmental Management from 2000 to 2006  In this article  I argue in defense of considering budget for environmental management in the discussion on climate change
