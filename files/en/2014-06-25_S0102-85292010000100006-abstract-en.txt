This study examines the discursive strategies related to the concept of terrorism used by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair  from Derrida s post structuralist approach  The attacks of September 11th  2001  upon the United States were taken as reference to analyse how the issue of terrorism moved from a peripheral position of the discursive agenda of the former Prime Minister to the center of their narratives after this date  At the same time that the reference to terrorism wins centrality  instabilities are also generated due to the increased use of the term  In the specific case of Tony Blair  the author of the discourses chooses to recognize these instabilities and try to relativise them from a contextualization and description of the specificities of the terrorist phenomenon
