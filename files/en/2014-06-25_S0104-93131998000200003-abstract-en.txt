The category of  unemployment  is the product of a social  statistical and juridical construction which can be traced to a period between late 19th and early 20th century Europe  It emerged from a reformulation of the  social question  which turned until the end of the 18th century on the notion of  poverty  and in the 19th century on one of  pauperism  The macro social notion of  unemployment  is subsequently found at the core of a new paradigm of representation and action  one which culminates in Beveridge s program for  full employment  in post war democratic societies  From the 1960s  we witness a progressive  deconstruction  of the notion of unemployment  a process in some aspects symmetrical to that which led to the  invention of unemployment  This process undermines an economic discourse which has based its post war legitimacy on the success of  full employment  policies
