Abstract  The article examines the difficulties faced by government projects aimed at fostering citizens  political participation by using the Internet  After presenting the participatory tools found on two institutional websites  the Brazilian Presidency and the House of Representatives  I examine how the constraints pointed out by a relevant part of the literature in e participation are reflected on such initiatives  The discussion grounded on empirical evidences highlights the argument that promoting online participation needs more than providing communication resources  since civic culture and other issues are still key factors in influencing our patterns of political involvement  A participatory use of digital tools will then depend more on circumstances such as institutional willingness than on the technical mechanisms available
