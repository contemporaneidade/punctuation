This article works from the perspective of social constructivism on sexuality with the aim of discussing the emergence of modern  sexual identities  I identify  on the one hand  the  invention  of homosexuality  and  consequently  of heterosexuality  in the discursive production of Victorian society  On the other hand  I discuss the form in which this new category becomes the basis of a political strife that vindicates sexual diversity  focusing mainly on the evolution of sexual orientation politics in 20th  century North American society
