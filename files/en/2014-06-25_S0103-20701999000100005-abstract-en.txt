This paper analyses the notion of prejudice based on appearance developed by Oracy Nogueira for the understanding of Brazilian racism  Prejudice based on appearance indicates a form of social classification based on racial stereotypes which is at the same time a form of discrimination  As such  it implies a social system that permanently delays colored people s social opportunities  instead of segregating them as a different group  This kind of prejudice is compared to another one  the prejudice based on origin characteristic of northern American society  The paper examines the intellectual context in which the notion was developed  emphasizing the presence of ethnographic tradition among the various influences which shaped the learning of social sciences at Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol tica  S o Paulo  during the 1940 s and the 1950 s  It also emphasizes the originality and contemporariness of this notion  which suggests the vision of racism as a cultural system
