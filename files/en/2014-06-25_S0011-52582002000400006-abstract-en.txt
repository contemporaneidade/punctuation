This is an exploratory study on geographic displacement patterns among researchers in Brazil during the 1990s  The mobility of researchers has not been studied in Brazil since the 1970s  when the country s demographic panorama was quite different from the present  The results indicate a rather intense migratory pattern  particularly between States of the country  and that the most frequent motive was the search for better work conditions  The Southeast region is the greatest magnet for skilled human resources  and the mobility pattern there is much complex merely than a migratory route from the North and Northeast to Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo  Finally  the data suggest that migration increased during the 1990s and that there was an appreciable brain drain out of the country
