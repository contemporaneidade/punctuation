This article presents the salat  an Islamic prayer and  at the same time  an important performatic element of Islamic religion  The salat is a corporeal elaboration that builds the Islamic body and allows us to see this body as a way of communication between God and the faithful  My analysis of the salat considers a close relation between the actor who repeats and rehearses his part in a play many times and the Muslim who prays and improves his performance each time he prays  My main argument is that the Muslim has to consider the knowledge of word  the voice and the gesture to improve his religious performance
