The article explores the use of geopolitical criteria as a method for classifying art  so as to revise criteria considered prejudicial to the appreciation of art in its symbolic and sociological dimension  With reference to Brazilian art  it presents classification models that are based on dichotomies such as exoticism vs  civilization  centre vs  periphery and nation vs  universalism  these models have informed museum directors  historians  art critics and curators  for more than a century  Those dichotomies are analysed in critical discourses from colonial paintings as well as those related with Brazilian modernism  It concludes that only a study of the finer nuances of the interactions between individuals and groups can lead to the comprehension of the complexity of artistic creation processes  breaking free from the constraints of geopolitical classification categories and permiting its transit through yet unknown areas
