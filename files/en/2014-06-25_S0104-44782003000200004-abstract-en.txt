This article initiates a theoretical and methodological discussion on the problems raised in Robert D  Putnam s Making Democracy Work  published in 1993  Looking at its structural logic as well as its analytical affinities with earlier literature  the paper focuses specifically on the theoretical and empirical meanings of the concepts of  social capital  and  confidence  It concludes by identifying a research agenda that  while promising  is also evidently  immature  both from the point of view of the theory s empirical operationalization as well as in relation to a need for more precise analytical specification of the meaning of its central categories
