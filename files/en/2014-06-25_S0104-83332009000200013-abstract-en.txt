In this work we propose to question how the speeches on sexuality  gender and sexual identity are built and validated  emerging from the life story of three homosexual brothers who were born in the inland areas of the Brazilian northeast  When they were still young  they migrated to Diadema  in S o Paulo  where in the course of time  they became transvestites and sex professionals  The perception of homosexuality was reported as part of childhood and sensed as a natural force  Now  the modifications made in the body due to  travestilidade  the decision on prostitution  the sex orientation  to men or to women  and the building of a sexual identity  gay or transvestite  came to view as fields dissociated from each other and related to the search of individual and social valorization before the stigma attached to the effeminate  poor and migrant gay  The Afro Brazilian religiosity and the Yoruba grammar assumed relevance to the constitution of this possibility of identity
