This article discusses how the main trends and impacts of capitalist dynamics are felt in Mozambique  based on a case study of the cashew industry  especially its industrial processing component  Having emerged in the colonial period  the cashew industry provides a practical example of Mozambique s integration in the world economy through the exploitation of natural resources and the local labor force to manufacture products for the main central markets  In order to better understand this industry s evolution and current situation  the author conducted his fieldwork in various places  especially in two cashew nut processing plants in the district of Manjacaze  Gaza Province  He thus adopted a methodological strategy based on a multilocal ethnography rather than a classical approach centered on the study of a single location or a supposedly isolated and autonomous community
