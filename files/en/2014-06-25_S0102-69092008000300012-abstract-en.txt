The paper analyses the possible influences of the Austrian phenomenologist Gustav Ichheiser on the work of Erving Goffman  It emphasizes  mainly  the scope of failure and misunderstandings in both social and individual relations  We establish connections to the notion of negotiation of the reality and to other relevant authors towards the development of this line of reflection  such as Georg Simmel  William James  William Thomas  and Alfred Schutz
