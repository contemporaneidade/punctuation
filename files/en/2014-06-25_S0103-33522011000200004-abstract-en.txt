This paper discusses the relationship between media and the creation of types from the point of view of an analysis of the concept of stereotypes  The mention of stereotypes in media analyses  in a wider sense  and of the news in particular  does not mean necessarily making that concept explicit  It also does not correspond to an analysis of its connections with other current concepts in media analysis  as agenda and framing  This study is a contribution to a theoretical analysis of media stereotypes  understanding them as moral and ideological artifacts  The analyses it includes show the meanings of that definition  taking into account the tensions and ambiguities present in the dynamics of reproduction and overcoming of stereotypes in journalistic discourse
