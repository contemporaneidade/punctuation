This article discusses presuppositions and approaches for a study on representations of the body in early modern Portugal  It focuses on medicine  but it also deals with other scholarly domains such as philosophy and literature  It addresses two related questions  the more general question of the links between representations of the body  ideas and historical processes in their cultural context  and the more particular problem of the way these representations express concepts and modes of thought in the medical milieu  This proposal is based on the premise that an enquiry into images used by thinkers illuminates the shaded spectrum of intellectual influences among them
