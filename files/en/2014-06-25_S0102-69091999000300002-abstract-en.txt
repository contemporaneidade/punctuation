After contrasting the inclusive  universal character of democratic notions of political citizenship  within the relevant jurisdiction  with the exclusivity that necessarily marks civil society the essay argues that the interstices between these two forms will favour the production of multiple variants of  incivility  The category of  uncivil citizens  is defined as those who enjoy political rights but are not constrained by the norms of the civil society  anti social individuals and groups whose recognizable shorthand can be found in the term  mafia  The essay then focuses on whether the greatest threat to civil society may come neither from intrusive statism nor from unthinking tradition  but from the  insecurity  rootlessness  arbitrariness  and perhaps even the social cannibalism  that have come to be associated with many post transition liberalized societies
