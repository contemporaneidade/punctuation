This article proposes strategies for research that contributes to a Sociology of Judiciary Elites  For these purposes  it advocates the need to articulate research that identifies the professed values of juridical agents and analyzes the institutions within which these agents are socialized while going on to study their decisions  The first part of this article  we present results of a questionnaire that we applied to Paran  State  Tribunal de Justi a do Paran  court judges  during the year 2006  regarding their juridical values  The second part makes some considerations on the need to study our interviewees  exogenous and endogenous socialization processes  in order to be able to understand some of responses we analyzed in the previous section  Finally  we advocate the need for behavioral study of these agents through qualitative and quantitative study of their decisions  The article does not intend to offer definitive conclusions  given the still preliminary nature of some of our research
