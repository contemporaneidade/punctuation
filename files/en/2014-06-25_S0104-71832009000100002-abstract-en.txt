Given a renewed interest on immigrants and cities  I examine the continuities and changes in the positioning and roles played by Portuguese migrants and their local and transnational practices against the repositioning of New Bedford  MA and Portugal in the global political economy  Instead of adopting the ethnic group as my unit of analysis  I centralize my attention on New Bedford and local level politics to explain the relations among globalization  city scale and migrants  incorporation  By interrelating local and global processes  I show how the incorporation of these migrants in New Bedford is enmeshed with their simultaneous incorporation in Portugal and  by extension  in the European Union  From this perspective  I expose the apparent paradoxes that permeate the ongoing neo liberal projects which are grounded upon the organization of flexible labor  restrictive immigration policies favoring national security and the criminalization of immigrants  and ideologies of cultural diversity as well
