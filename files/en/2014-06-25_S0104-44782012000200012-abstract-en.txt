This article attempts an inventory of the numerous initiatives of the Lula government  2003 2010  with regard to the establishing of human resource policy and  in this regard  seeks to verify if there has been improvement in working conditions and relations in the Brazilian public sector  As of the 1990s and against the grain of the major growth of public employment over the previous six decades  Brazilian government adhesion to the principles of the  Washington Consensus  has made it clear how civil service becomes a crucial issue on the agenda of reforms deemed necessary to recover economic growth  Such governments have tended to deal with public employment as a fiscal problem and have acted in such as way as to restrict it  Simultanteously  work conditions and relations have become more precarious  as evidenced by the absence of inflation adjustments  the increase in variable forms of wages and salaries  increased temporary and subcontracted labor and authoritarian positions regarding labor unions  Through documentary and bibliographic research  we have been able to see that the restructuring of different careers  new employment openings  the creation of a National Board of Permanent Negotiation  social security system reform and selective wage readjustment show that ambiguity is the fundamental trait of human resource policies  This is due to the fact that improvements in civil servants  working conditions have been accompanied by the maintenance of a part of the conservative agenda of the 1990s  particularly that part that has sought to reproduce rigorous fiscal limits
