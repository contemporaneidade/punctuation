This article aims to discuss how it is formed the so called  design artcraft  which comes to life with the convergence of technical practices of designers and the  traditional knowledge  of artisans  This knowledge is said to be passed from generation to generation  Taking into account my fieldwork experience with artisans in Bras lia  I try and unveil how emerges the notion that artcraft production should follow formal and aesthetical requirements in order to please the consumers and thus succeed in the market  Some  myths  regarding the artcraft work are put at stake on the paper  which shows how symbolic disputes among artisans  designers and institutions emerge in the field  I chose to approach artcrafts in Bras lia as a field  in accordance to the concept of Pierre Bourdieu  By so doing  I was able to identify the most relevant social actors and the roles they play in this specific case  This concept also allows me to reveal the power struggles that institute practices and form this field  I try to link Bourdieu s approach to the symbolic interactionism of Georg Simmel and Erving Goffman  Although these authors have their particularities  both share the common notion of a social constructed reality through the experience of the actors within a specific context  In addition to these references  I also incorporated in my analysis a perspective of Geertz  who emphasizes the importance of the context and interpretation for the symbolic anthropology
