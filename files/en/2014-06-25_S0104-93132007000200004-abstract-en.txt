The article argues for the existence of a financial mode of domination in Brazilian society at the start of the 21st century  In support of this claim  it provides a chronology of the recent transformations in Brazilian economic culture and draws evidence from various spheres   i  on the success of the rhetoric justifying the continuance of high interest rates in the country  supposedly a response to the disorganization of Brazilian society   ii  on the propagation of corporate governance  increasingly advocated as the ideal method for managing and evaluating  modern  organizations   iii  on the logic adopted by the explicit critique of financial domination  which attempts to personify the phenomenon in the form of  exemplary  individuals  In all three cases  the pre eminence of the arguments sustaining the financial viewpoint   seen as positive within the ideological framework of the proposed chronology   are contrasted with the difficulties faced by its critique  associated with its negative poles
