The objective of this article is to study the content and reception of Raymundo Faoro s work in Brazil  comparing it to his Weberian theoretical matrix and postulating that his concept of patrimonialism limits the original explanatory capacity by linking patrimonialism merely to a centralized and powerful political structure and by overlooking the facet of its decentralization and state inoperability  The biased utilization of Weberian theory influences the critiques of Faoro s work  which err when they move from  pertinently  contesting the author s heavy and fatalistic interpretation of Weber to challenging the explanatory potential of the Weberian concept per se  The article thus presents other authors who take a more variegated approach to the theme of patrimonialism  without denying its interpretative importance  Finally  the article emphasizes how Faoro s ideas contributed  unintentionally  by the way  to shaping an anti statist  privatist  and ultimately oligarchic political culture in recent Brazil  In Brazil  the concept of patrimonialism has exerted a seminal influence and sparked controversies and distinct interpretations   thus  the best stance in such an important discussion is to attempt to clarify the concept  and that is what we have attempted to do  within our limitations
