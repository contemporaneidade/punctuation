Comparing political trajectories over the course of a century demands more forgetting than remembering  I will make an attempt here to convert a considerable amount of very heterogeneous analytical material into some  Popperian  conjectures  They may emerge from anywhere within and may be subjected to corroboration or refutation  In other words  this process is precisely the reverse of the one that informs strictly academic tasks  To some extent  I begin my work  from scratch  It may be true that the history of democracy in Argentina is longer than that of Brazil  Nonetheless  this difference does not invalidate comparison  My concise hypothesis is the following  in Brazilian democratic politics  the institutional dimension prevails   institutions  in fact  represent the place in which interactions occur and collective actors take shape  In compensation  within these institutions  both social and political inclusion has been weak  However  in the Argentine case  the inclusive dimension has been dominant  in clear detriment to the one  In Argentine democratic politics   everyone  was included  In Brazilian democratic politics until 1964  stability was based on exclusion   for example  the exclusion of the rural masses  These hypotheses may be correct or incorrect but in any case  it is important to emphasize that they have not been established ex nihilo  as if coming from nowhere and neither diachronic nor synchronic  Diachronic  insofar as the history of the 20th century is sustained  obviously  in the history of the preceding one  synchronic  because each of the hypotheses or conjectures discussed here are undeniably embedded in processes that are proper to the 20th century  its dramas  struggles  leaders  conflicts  controversies  political administrations  periods of depression and prosperity and hopes  in short  all that makes up the history of the century
