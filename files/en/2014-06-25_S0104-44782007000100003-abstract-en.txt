Brazil underwent industrialization and major economic development during the period that spanned 1930 to 1980 This is the period of strategic national development initiated by Getulio Vargas and taken up again after the crisis of the 1960s by the military regime that was in power  Throughout the entire period  public bureaucracy played a key role  always in consort with the industrial bourgeoisie  These two classes emerged as actors in political life as of the 1930s and  together with the workers who were minor partners   promoted the Brazilian industrial revolution  During the 1960s the radicalization of the Left and the right wing alarmism which were both to a large extent stimulated by the Cuban revolution led to a military coup in which the bourgeoisie and the military joined interests with the United States  Nonetheless  both the bourgeoisie and public bureaucracy returned to a nationalist and developmentalist policy during the years that followed  Yet the major foreign debt crisis that took place during the 1980s led to the breaking apart of these alliances  and over the course of the decade  to the surrender to neo liberalism coming from the North  At that moment  a disoriented public bureaucracy attempted to defend its own corporate interests  As of the 1990s  however  the sector involved itself in the State Administrative Reform of 1995  furthermore  neoliberalism  which then became the dominant current  went on to lose its hegemony over the following decade due to failure in promoting economic development  These two facts work  on the one hand  to re establish new republican perspectives for public bureaucracy and  on the other  suggest that the renewed alliance of public bureaucracy and industrial bourgeoisie may again be turning into the nation s route to re establishing economic development
