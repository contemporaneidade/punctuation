This paper analyzes the concept of group and its manifestations  seeking to contrast the categorial perspectives of both psychoanalysis and sociological theory  which are considered incomplete because of unilateral stylizations that prevent a basic conceptual connection between the two disciplines  with a terminology conceived to be neutral faced with positive and negative alternatives for insertion of the self in the group  To this end  the group  regardless of its size and type  should be initially understood as a social mechanism based on the individual s psychic need or interest  because it helps in his stability and personal development  The article outlines the unified categorial framework resorting to the concept of recognition  In a first step  I briefly present the premise that the individual s dependence on experiences of social recognition explains why the subject individually aspires to membership in different models of social groupings  In a second step  I try to correct the previously introduced idealized image of group  by thematizing the regressive tendencies that often co determine the experiencing within the group  Finally  I proceed with the idea of progressively withdrawing those idealizations that were based on the initial premise of a harmonic blending of I in we in the group
