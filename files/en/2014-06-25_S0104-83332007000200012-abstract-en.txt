The central themes of this article  family reunification in general  and DNA testing in particular  came to the fore during a research project about young Somalians in Finland  Since 1996  I have been conducting ethnographic research   in schools  youth clubs  streets and caf s   with youngsters from Somalia who arrived in Finland around 1994  and who attend Finnish schools in the suburbs of Helsinki  My general interest in this longitudinal study was to learn about the experiences of coming of age in highly dispersed settings  not only in the vein of a local host country  but also culturally and transnationally  Here  growing up is seen not as a simple biological question  It is a social process in which relationships such as kinship ties are constituted  experienced  and contested  These are powerful relations for individual and social identifications  DNA testing may both symbolically and physically violate this social process of intimate identifications and personal integrity
