In Brazil the executive has exclusive rights to initiate the annual budget  Legislators have the right to amend the bill  but only if those amendments are compatible with the multi year budget plan elaborated by the executive as well as with the law on budgetary guidelines  Moreover  congress may not authorize expenditures that exceed the budgetary revenue  It is also the executive  who is entitled to determine which amendment will really be appropriated  as the appropriation is contingent on the availability of resources in the national treasury  This paper argues that those rules not only restrict congressional action  but also enable the president to preserve at low costs its coalition inside Congress  It shows strong evidence that the Brazilian President rewards those legislators who most vote for his interests by executing their individual amendments to the annual budget and  equally  punishes those who vote less by not executing their individual amendments
