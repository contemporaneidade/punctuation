The Bellagio Report on Healthy Agriculture  Healthy Nutrition  Healthy People was science based but policy oriented  The role and amount of healthy and unhealthy nutrients in foods that may underlie the epidemics of non communicable diseases worldwide was extensively discussed  with attention to the relative content of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids  and also sugar  particularly fructose  The report concludes that sugar consumption  especially in the form of high energy fructose in soft drinks  poses a major and insidious health threat  and most diets are defficient in omega 3 fatty acids and too high in omega 6 fatty acids  The meeting established that  governments must elevate  as a matter of urgency  Nutrition to a national priority  access to a healthy diet should be considered a human right  and the lead responsibility for Nutrition should be placed in Ministries of Health rather than Agriculture so that the health requirements drive agricultural priorities  not vice versa
