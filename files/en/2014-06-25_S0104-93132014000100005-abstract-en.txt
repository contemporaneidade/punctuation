This article focuses on distinct modalities of the tutelary administration of territories and populations  which were put into practice by government officials in different moments of Brazilian history  By establishing connections between data from domains of anthropological and social science investigation that rarely enter into dialogue  as is the case with studies of Indigenous populations and of residents of shanty towns and peripheries  the article aims to promote ethnographic comparisons that highlight under considered aspects of processes of nation building  establishing an analytical bridge that favours a more in depth comprehension of the different uses of the same category in distinct contexts  thereby making explicit hypotheses for research and systematic investigations
