The central objective of this study was to analyze the work of the Judiciary Branch in the privatizations process carried out in Brazil during the 1990s  The article attempts to demonstrate that although the Judiciary has been called on as arbiter of political conflicts  in the case of privatizations it did not respond to this demand  leaving incomplete what we refer to as a judicialization cycle  without which one cannot speak of the judicialization of politics per se  Finally  the article seeks to call attention to the need to exercise greater parsimony and precision with the term  judicialization of politics  increasingly present in Brazilian political science analyses
