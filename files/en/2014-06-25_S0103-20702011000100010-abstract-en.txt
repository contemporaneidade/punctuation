In this essay I analyse Heidegger s philosophical reflection on the relationship between human beings and animals  particularly as these ideas unfold in works like Letter on humanism  On the way to language and The fundamental concepts of metaphysics  My aim is to show the importance of this contribution to understanding the way in which Agamben reinterprets the Foucauldian concept of biopower  For Agamben  the animalization of politics is not a modern phenomenon  but concerns what remains unthought in metaphysics as a whole  Indeed his broader critique of Western political culture   which does not restrict itself merely to the analysis of modern forms of administrating life   draws heavily on Heidegger s reflection on nihilism  metaphysics and the troublesome figure of the animal  My final proposal in this text is to discuss  with Agamben  but also with Derrida  the extent to which Heidegger is successful in offering a theoretical framework capable of apprehending contemporary forms of biopower on grounds radically distinct from those inherited from metaphysics
