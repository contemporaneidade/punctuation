This article presents a series of indicators for analysis of internet conversations through the prism of theories of deliberative democracy  The model we propose is made up of an examination of the structure of an on line forum  the evaluation of actors involved in the debate  reflections on the context of discussion and analysis of the  deliberativeness  of the messages themselves  based on Habermas  principles for the public sphere  Finally  the described model of on line deliberation is applied to messages taken from the on line forum  Digital Participatory Budgeting  from Belo Horizonte  Application of the model indicates that the discussion brought positive deliberative results  especially with regard to message justification and respect for other users  Finally  we argue that the model can be widely applied to on line discussions in different platforms  or   with certain adaptations  to other discursive means  such as mass media or live parliamentary debate
