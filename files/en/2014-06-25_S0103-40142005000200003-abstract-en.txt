DURING THE first 470 years of the colonization of the Brazilian Amazon  only 1  of the area was deforested  In the last 35 years  1970 2005  however  deforestation has already claimed 17  of the region  whose population increased from two million to over 20 million people  Today  the colonization of the Brazilian Amazon finds itself in a stage of unparalleled expansion  even if fiscal incentives now play a secondary role  In other words  government driven development has been replaced by private initiatives whose economic activities have become profitable  The main forces of transformation derive from the demands both of the country s domestic markets  especially those in the south and central regions  and of the international marketplace  The main activities responsible for this transformation are logging  cattle raising  grain production  mining  hydroelectric energy production  and oil and energy prospecting  These were invigorated by the implementation of a highway system that now crisscrosses the region from north to south and east to west  replacing or supplementing the navigable rivers used before for transportation
