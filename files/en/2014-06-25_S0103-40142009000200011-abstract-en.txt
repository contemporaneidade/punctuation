This article discusses the impacts of the international crisis on the Brazilian economy  with emphasis on the virtual paralysis of the domestic banking credit market that has occurred since September 2008  It argues that the dynamics of banking competition led to the emergence of high risk practices  The destabilizing potential of these practices came to light when the aggravation of the international financial crisis and its contagion in peripheral countries such as Brazil caused a reversal of expectations  Generalized conservative behavior by banks during the retraction phase was exacerbated in Brazil by the relatively short credit cycle and by the liquidity  profitability and low risk of public bonds  allowing a rapid recomposition of portfolios  The Central Bank  sticking to its mandate as the guardian of price stability  failed to move to mitigate the deceleration of productive activities that resulted from the contraction of credit
