The backdrop of this paper is the radical transformation of the entrepreneurial world in winegrowing that has been brought about by the entrance of new producers and the emergence of a new and now global culture of wine consumption  I analyze this transformation in the light of contributions made by a new Economic Sociology  as well as by social science perspectives on science and technology  The  popularization  of consumption is a reflection of the growth in the offer of quality wines as well as the price drop that has been made possible through the dissemination of technology and knowledge  This process has led to a loss of the  secrecy  that once surrounded the production of quality wines  what was once the privilege of a few producers and regions  kept under lock and key by family producers  has now become an object that can be apprehended and obtained through investments in technology and training  As a result  new producers of high quality wine have emerged in countries like Chile  Australia  South Africa and Brazil  among others  This transformation may be seen from two particular angles  one which focuses on the product s lost  aura  and with it  producers  and consumers  loss of privilege  and another which is linked to the social production of a new market including new producers and widening consumer access to quality wines    This expansion of supply and consumption of quality wines has  nonetheless  been accompanied by the transformation of traditional winegrowers into cult objects that have become synonymous with exclusivity and distinction  The latter have thus become more restrictive and their wines  overvalued
