This ethnographic essay is an analysis of the Paumari relational sociology  It proceeds from the observation that any relationship established between the Paumari and other beings is quickly defined in commercial terms  However  this  commercialization of relationships  extends far beyond the everyday  since figures such as the  boss  and the  employee  are encountered at various levels of Paumari cosmology  My working hypothesis is that  for the Paumari  commercial relations are the relations par excellence  I attempt to show  therefore  that in a world populated by potentially social beings  the Paumari imagine themselves to occupy  by preference  the position of domestic prey animal or pet  In turn  this position corresponds in many aspects to the position of guest employee   a correlation which becomes clearer when examined in relation to the region s history and the three basic dimensions of the Amazonian symbolic economy
