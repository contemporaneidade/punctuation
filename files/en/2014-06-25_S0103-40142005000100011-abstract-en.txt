THE VEGETATION fires in tropical areas of the Earth are important sources of pollutants to the atmosphere  In South America  during the winter months  an area  mainly of cerrado and forest ecosystems  of approximately 40 thousand square kilometers is burned annually  The biomass burning occurs primarily in Amazon and Central of Brazil regions  but through atmospheric transport these emissions results in a spatial distribution of smoke over an extent area  of about 4 5 millions of square kilometers  much higher than the area where the fires are concentrated  During the combustion process are emitted to the atmosphere gases pollutants and aerosol particles that interact efficiently with radiation  microphysics process  dynamic of cloud formation and the air quality  The effects of these emissions exceed  therefore  the local scale and affect regionally the composition and physical and chemical properties of the South America atmosphere and neighborhood oceanic areas  with potential impact in a global scale
