This article aims to present Critical Theory in International Relations  It is understood that there has been a lacuna in theoretical debates with little attention paid to this tradition in Brazil  The current revival in theoretical discussions contributes to the weakening of conventional theories  The role of Critical Theory in this trend is fundamental  Frankfurt School Critical Theory is examined as a philosophical and metatheoretical forerunner to its International Relations  counterpart  There follows the epistemological bases for the challenges Critical Theory poses to conventional approaches  with particular regard to the work of Robert W  Cox  Neo Gramscian thought is thus in the light of concerns for social transformation in International Relations  The Critical International Theory perspective is subsequently scrutinized as a source for emancipatory concerns of IR scholars  The work of Andrew Linklater is presented due to the search for the transformation of political communities by way of the expansion of moral boundaries  A critical assessment of the impacts of Critical Theory to the field of International Relations is thus presented  This article concludes that Critical Theory is largely accountable for the turn towards the ontological and epistemological issues that have distinguished this field of study within the last few decades  by exposing the consequential shortcomings of the predominant conventional theoretical approaches  However  Critical Theory is deliberately associated to post positivist epistemologies
