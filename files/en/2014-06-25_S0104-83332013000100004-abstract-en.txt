In my research on the topic of political memory  particularly those participating in the armed resistance in Brazil  it was possible to detect significant differences in autobiographical narratives about the years of political activism  Despite the difficulties of generalizations about traumatic experiences  three issues proved to be decisive  The first refers to gender differences  the second to the degree of violence suffered and the third  and perhaps most important  the subjective position of the active subject versus the position of the victim  So what you can remember depends very much on the subject and subjective positions
