The aim of this paper is to discuss and to determine Florestan s polemical thesis about the role of liberalism along the Independence Revolution in Brazil  We begin our discussion of this thesis criticizing the pattern of exposition adopted by Florestan in A revolu o burguesa no Brasil  This pattern of exposition makes it difficult to learn the material and historical fundamentals of liberalism utopic polarization during the first half of the nineteenth century  From this criticism we extract a proposal of translating Florestan s work  as a way of clarifying it and making the material fundamentals that structure it explicit  Developing and presenting a particular proposal of translation is our goal in the second part of this paper
