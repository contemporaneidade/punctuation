The article challenges the thesis of the weakness of Brazilian associational life in the 1800 s  through the analysis of the associations formed in the country to protest against slavery during the second half of the 19th century  Conversely to the thesis of lack of solidarity  the survey on the number of antislavery associations created and on the social heterogeneity of their members shows the exuberance of associational civic activity in Imperial Brazil  In addition  the paper argues that shifts toward expansion or decline of antislavery associational activity can be explained by changes in  political opportunities   Tarrow  1998
