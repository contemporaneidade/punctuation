The striking events of the World Social Forums  succeeded by the entry of new actors into the Brazilian political scenario launched in 2003  involved a set of both promising and unknown new possibilities for the solidarity economy  The understanding of such moments  signaling both future advances and questions  requires examining recent steps in order to unveil the meaning of the new pathways and the demands they raise  given the new choices that need to be made  This article discusses the formulations of militant praxis in the solidarity economy and analyzes some of the problems permeating its history in recent years  based primarily on empirical studies on its evolution in the State of Rio Grande do Sul in relation to actual experiences and mediating organizations  The paper identifies some of the necessary changes and innovations in the conceptualization and implementation of the solidarity economy  in the sense of expanding its frontiers and legitimizing and agglutinating its various watersheds and expressions in order to establish it as an effective pillar for an alternative development and globalization process
