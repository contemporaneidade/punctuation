The examination of cultural practices and preferences based on intra individual behavior variation fosters a portrait of the social world that does not rule out individual singularities and that avoids cultural caricatures of social groups  thereby revealing that the border between  cultural legitimacy  and  cultural illegitimacy  not only separates different social classes  but also shares the different cultural practices and preferences by the same individuals in all classes  Without questioning the existence of social inequalities vis vis the more legitimate cultural forms  this approach allows highlighting the statistical frequency of individual cultural profiles formed by heterogeneous and dissonant elements  Consideration of the socio historical conditions in the production of heterogeneous cultural profiles unveils the consequences of these frequent cultural dissonances from the perspective of interpreting the social functions of culture  thus emphasizing the interest in studying individual variations in behaviors within a sociology of dispositional and contextual plurality
