The Brazilian business community became involved in a noteworthy process of organization and political mobilization throughout the 1990 s  Its action branched out into different areas  both in the domestic sphere  with the campaign for the reduction of the Brazil cost  and in the international sphere  with the creation of the Brazilian Business Coalition  This result stemmed from the confluence of a process of economic nature  which set up competitiveness to the level of a top priority goal for the firms  and a process of political nature  with the performance of political entrepreneurs that helped to start off and to sustain the collective action  The initiative for collective action originated from where the exponents of the theory of political weakness of the Brazilian business community least expected it to  the National Confederation of Industry  a peak association of the corporatist system of representation of industrial interests  This article  therefore  simultaneously challenges two central statements that are present in a significant part of the literature  first  the idea that the Brazilian business community is incapable of collective action  second  the idea that corporatism is the primary cause of this incapacity
