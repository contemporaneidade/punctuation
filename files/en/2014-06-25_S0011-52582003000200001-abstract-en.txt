Raymundo Faoro  deceased in 2003  was one of the pioneers in the use of Max Weber s sociology for interpreting the formation of the Brazilian political system  In Os Donos do Poder  The Owners of Power  first published in 1958  Faoro launched the thesis that ever since its colonial period Brazil has always been dominated by a  bureaucratic stratum  with its origins in the peculiar characteristics of the Portuguese state  thus contradicting the previously dominant view that Brazil had experienced a feudal past dominated by traditional rural power  He thus opened the way for the Brazilian political system to be studied and interpreted in terms of its own political and institutional variables and no longer merely in terms of class interests and conflicts  However  according to Faoro  this domination by the bureaucratic stratum was a perennial  immutable characteristic of Brazil  a view that ended up limiting his analyses  even as he became an activist against all forms of Brazilian authoritarianism
