This article analyzes egocentered networks of social support in Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo using data from a survey carried out in 2008  Following the results of a previous research about personal networks in S o Paulo  we investigate the main characteristics  dynamics and conditioning factors of the networks  evidencing strong regularities along the life cycle and between social groups  Regardless of those regularities  the results indicate intense relational heterogeneity inside each social group  organized both among the poor and the non poor by the homophily and localism of the networks  generating strong consequences for the reproduction of social inequalities
