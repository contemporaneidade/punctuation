This article examines the mathematical works of William Rowan Hamilton that led him to characterize certain mathematical objects named Quaternions  in the years between 1843 and 1866  Many expectations about practical applications of the Quaternions were posed  specially the challenge of synthesize the representation of scalar and vector magnitudes  howewer  few years later  these expectations were frustated  and new kinds of powerful instruments came out in mathematical scene  like tensors  for instance  Hamilton s researches  nevertheless  contributed vividly to Algebra s development  underlining the meaning of several algebrical themes  There is another reason to read Hamilton s works in their original form  exploring life and death of the Quaternions  the importance of History of Science becomes evident  in order to instruct and guide pedagogical actions  specially in mathematical and physical themes
