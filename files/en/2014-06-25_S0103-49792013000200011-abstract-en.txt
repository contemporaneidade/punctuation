The goal of this paper is to reflect on and understand how ex con trash pickers in the city of Fortaleza established a new worker identity through socially stigmatized unstable employment  Both bibliographical documentary research and an ethnographical inspiration study were carried out  using direct observation and semi structured interviews as tools  The results indicate unstable working conditions and conflicts with the  deposeiros   recycling center owners  who exploit the trash pickers in every way possible  People regard these workers as dangerous  dirty bums  and their working and living conditions are riddled with exploitation  conflict and prejudice  The narratives of these recycled people for justice reveal a strong identity with the refuse that they collect  In their quest for reentry to society and reconstruction of identity  some of them admitted to illicit practices or recidivism  thereby demonstrating the fragility of the system  which attempts to recycle them and include them in a precarious manner
