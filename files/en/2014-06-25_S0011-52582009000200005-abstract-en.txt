This article examines the political determinants of privatization of the fixed telephony sector in four countries  based on a neo institutionalist approach  These countries faced similar pressures by telephone companies in favor of privatization  suggesting an apparent convergence in the sector s reorganization  However  although all four adopted some degree of privatization  the process followed different paths and designs in each country  This variation can be explained by the different institutional contexts in which the reforms were carried out  Where there was concentration of power in the Executive  privatization was launched  earlier  and approved more quickly than in countries in which such concentration waslessintense  Meanwhile  the existence of multiple veto points and stakeholders with veto power did not impede the reform  but increased the cost of its unilateral adoption by the Executive  forcing the latter to negotiate and form a minimum consensus within the governing coalition
