In this article  I address the Taoist conception of human life cycle from the perspective of an Anthropology of the body  that investigates not only beliefs and ideas about the body  but also bodily practice as embodied experience  According to Taoism  the coming of old age does not have to be lived as a time of decrepitude and illness  as Taoists recognise the possibility of reversing the movement that leads to death  Such traditional concern with health and longevity connects the Taoist practices  though exotic and highly unkown in Brazil  with the contemporary obsession with keeping young and having the perfect body in globalized societies  At the same time  contemporary embodied reinterpretations of Taoism can be understood as an alternative to consumers  bodies  Taoist longevity is an effect of an aesthethics of existence  embedded in a whole way of living  that contrasts with the dazzling speed of capitalist lives
