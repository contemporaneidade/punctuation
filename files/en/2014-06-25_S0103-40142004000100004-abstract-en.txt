IN THIS ARTICLE we used tools of molecular and population genetics to estimate quantitatively the African contribution for the formation of the Brazilian population  We examined two genomic compartments  mitochondrial DNA  mtDNA  maternally inherited  and nuclear DNA  inherited from both parents  The studies using mtDNA showed that about 30  of Brazilians self classified as White and 80  of Brazilian Negroes carry maternal lineages typical of Sub Saharan Africa  Using these data we could estimate that at least 89 million Brazilians are afrodescendants  a number considerably larger than the 76 million individuals self classified as Negro in the 2000 census  The analyses on nuclear polymorphisms employed  ancestry informative  markers and showed even more striking results  On the basis of studies in individuals self classified as White from several Brazilian regions  we estimated that approximately 146 million Brazilians  86  of the population  had more than 10  African contribution to their genome  These numbers should be taken into account in discussing affirmative action programs in Brazil  but in a descriptive rather than a prescriptive sense
