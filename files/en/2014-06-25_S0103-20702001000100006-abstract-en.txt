This article analyses the main obstacles to be faced for the political integration in Turkey  It shows that radicalism and violence spring from three sources  the Turkish Kurd opposition  the Sunite Alevite opposition and the rise of political Islamism  with its refusal to abandon religious reference What has contributed to the present political fragmentation are the contradictions of the Kemalist doctrine  on which the legitimacy of the Turkish State is based  the successive military coups d etat that cause constant party realignements  and the militarization of vast regions of Turkey to hold back the successive waves of Kurdish and Alevite violent uprisings  which  in turn  give autonomy to armed groups that tend to perpetuate the violent contends and repression  From this perspective  the future of Turkey depends  on the one hand  on the social integration of identifications and convictions  Kurds  Alevites and Islamites  for the recognition of regional cultures and  on the other  on the adoption of the principle of non politization of religious convictions and the abandonment of social conservatism as an opposition to westernization
