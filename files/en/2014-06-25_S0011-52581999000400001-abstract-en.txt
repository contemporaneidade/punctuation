The present article is a revision of democratic theory from the perspective of its inadequacies to account for the new   and not so new   democracies located outside the Northwestern quadrant of the world  It begins by examining various definitions of democracy  especially those that claiming to be Schumpeterian  are deemed to be minimalist  or processualist  and proposes a realistic and restricted  but not minimalist definition of a democratic regime  The connections of this topic with several others are then explored  including political  social  and welfare rights  the state  mainly in its legal dimension  and some features of the overall social context  The main grounding factor that results from these explorations is the conception of agency  as it is expressed in the legal system of existing democracies  although widely variable across cases
