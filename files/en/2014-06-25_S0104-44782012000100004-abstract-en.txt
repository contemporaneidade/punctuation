At present there is a paucity of work that seeks to clarify what a neo institutional theory of change is and what the fundamental elements to compare  evaluate and construct such a theory would be  The present paper proposes reflections on this issue  We carry out comparative analysis of four neoinstitutionalist theories of social change  We present points of convergence and controversy regarding the problem of endogeneity  the role of formal and informal institutions  typical explanatory patterns  causal mechanisms and the causal modes that typify different neo institutional models  Our main goal is to understand how these four traditional approaches to change respond to the challenge to explain processes of institutional change starting from institutions themselves  The study goes beyond a simple comparative analysis of theories and seeks to offer  in a preliminary sense  a method for the analysis of theory that makes it possible to explore the essential dimensions of available approaches to institutional change through the new institutionalism  What are the constitutive elements that make up an institutional theory per se  The method we use is constructed starting from the problems that are considered fundamental in the advancement of an institutional theory  For these purposes  we suggest that the one of the initial steps in the construction of theories of institutional change can be seen as associated with the growth of a demand for comparative analysis of theories  in the sense of a closer understanding of the problems entailed and refinement needed for the building such theories
