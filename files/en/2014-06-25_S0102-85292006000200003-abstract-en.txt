This essay begins with a methodological discussion about the fundamental outlines of the post 1989 international system  Influential scholars have defined the new system according to traditional variables  dependent upon the polarities scheme inherited from Cold War times and on realist methodological premises  The emergence of a  new phase  of the globalization process showed that to consider state power as a structural axis of the system   in which the United States play a prominent role   is misleading and blurs the  real  configuration of power in this new system  The invasion of Irak by U  S  forces in march 2003 consisted in a privileged laboratory to determine this  real  configuration of power  Following the persistence of a pattern of power and language tone characteristic of the Cold War times  e  g   who is not with us is in favor of terrorism  the absence of a competitor or state competitors that could rival American power made the invasion more than a violation of principles of Law and Ethics  It can also be considered misleading and counterproductive in the light of American interests themselves  given its misperceptions and misconceptions of the new international realities  Two further components of this scenario are probed deeper in the essay  a  the redundancy and  to a certain extent  uselessness of military weapons for the promotion of the national interest  and b  the formation of a  new bipolarism  which opposes United States republican foreign policy and the rising bloc of global civil society  This bloc has amassed impressive power resources  which make it the focus of an emergent international system  characterized by a new and atypical modality of conflict  The many empirical evidences gathered in the essay will hopefully sustain this argument
