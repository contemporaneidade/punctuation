This paper discusses Walter Benjamin s comments on the poems of the cycle  Handbook for city dwellers  by Bertolt Brecht  to discuss the specificity of Brechtian lyricism in the more general debate about the Benjamin s reflexions on modern urban lyricism  Benjamin takes up two critical issues to the constitution of Brecht s work   the sobriety of language and teaching as a means of transmission of the urban and political experience  This link between experience and transmission can not be reduced to the instruction of conditions of survival in the big city  but it is constituted principally in learning a critical stance towards the city  While communication between isolated individuals is poor  and political organization approaches the illegality  the poems aspire to the establishment of a link between  I  and  you  through a poetic reflection of urban experience
