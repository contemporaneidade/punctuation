This paper aims at showing that the theme of recognition is essential in redefining the sociological theory  In order to do so  some sociology classics are examined to show that in all of them the issue of recognition is somewhat implicit  Following that  the author seeks to show that the complexity of the recognition theme is in its double register  a positive one   the admission of a fact  of a person   and a normative one   opening towards love  respect  and self esteem dimensions   i e  towards a whole moral context subjacent to the positive dimension  According to him  the classical economy has built itself on the value merchandise idea  whereas the sociology is able to renovate itself from some social value that will only become visible when mankind is conceived as value itself  Finally  according to Caill  recognition is admitting there has been a gift  we are debtors to the one who has made it  continuing to interact with it  Therefore  if recognizing a person is both admitting his social value and offering anything as return  what is then socially noticed is the very existence of a gift
