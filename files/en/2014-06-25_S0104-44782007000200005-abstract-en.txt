Alex Callinicos 39 s intervention in the debate on the geopolitics of the states system and capitalist modernity provides a crucial wake up call to International Relations  ir  and International Political Economy  ipe  Yet  within the contending positions disputing the political economy of geopolitical conflict  interstate rivalry  and capitalist imperialism  the insights of Antonio Gramsci have been notably present by their absence  This article attempts to contribute to the dialogue initiated by Alex Callinicos by drawing attention to Gramsci 39 s relevance to theorising the relationship between the states system and capitalism  It does so by elaborating how the theory of passive revolution reveals the political rule of capital by internally relating the states system and capitalist modernity within a focus on uneven development  This concern is evident in Gramsci 39 s own analysis of Anglo Saxon capitalism and the geopolitics of the states system in his survey of Americanism and Fordism  This theorising of the passive revolution of capital might then provide a fruitful basis from which an empirical research agenda on social development could be advanced with reference to postcolonial state formation processes
