This article s basic premise is that the main challenge for Brazilian public schools is to redefine the terms of their relationship with the community  from the prevailing asymmetric and paternalistic pattern to an egalitarian and equitable one  This institutional challenge has been raised by a research agenda on the relationship between public schools and the  students  world  including their families and neighborhoods  The article presents an analysis of data from a survey with the schoolchildren s parents and guardians  nearly all of whom were slum residents  Based on a reading of the data  we reflect on the school s value for low income communities and how this points to a horizon of conflicts in the school s context  To deal with this scenario from the school administration s perspective  we draw on the notion of responsiveness from the sociology of law  which allows conceiving ways of turning expectations of social mobility and access to the city into greater institutionality and more democracy
