The article draws upon the discussion of the work of the French sociologist Alain Touraine in order to put forward a conceptualization of the relationship between social movements and civil society in a neofunctionalist framework  Challenging the marxist model and those which share its utilitarian assumptions  though not necessarily teleological  the author emphasizes the symbolic and cultural elements in the constitution of social movements and the role of contingency in history  He also criticizes the idea that the  new social movements  might have a revolutionary character  Alternatively  he sustains that social movements are the translation of civil society  whithin which inclusions and exclusions  as well as the very community  are defined  Social movements operate also an articulation  to a great extent of a discursive character  of the problems in particular institutional spheres of society with the metalanguage of civil society
