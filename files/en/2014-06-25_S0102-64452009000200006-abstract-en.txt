The objetive of the article is to emphasize the place of economics in the political cosmovision of Aristotle under the assumption of economics as a central dimension and a prerequisite of the philosopher s thinking about political community  In that sense  it covers three aspects of that problematic  The firs aspect  the most visible one  which discovery is merit of Arendtian hermeneutics  attends specifically to the problem of bad chrematistic as a deconstruction of the politics s object  in so far as communitarian life is related to the good life  The second aspect allows the philosopher to relate  for the first time in Western history  the political regimes to the social structure of the polis  The third aspect implies a vision of political regimes in economic terms and is the core of Aristotle s profound criticism of oligarchy  In that way  it makes explicit another assumptiom of this paper  that Aristotle s reflections are concentrated on the notion of public sphere and  for that reason  they privilege theoretically aristocracy  politeia  and even democracy
