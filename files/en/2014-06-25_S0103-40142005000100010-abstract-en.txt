DEMOGRAPHIC occupation of the Brazilian Legal Amazon within the past 50 years has lead to significant levels of deforestation as the result of several factors such as new road construction  urban growth  expansion of extensive cattle ranching  increasing timber extraction  and rising intensive agriculture of monocultures  The cumulative deforested area in Brazil s Legal Amazonia was approximately 653 000 km  in 2003  correspondingto 16 3  of the region  This study sought to assess deforestation within or near to protected areas  conservation units  and indigenous reserves in Legal Amazonia in the states of Mato Grosso  Rond nia  and Par  that jointly were responsible for more than 90  of regional deforestation from 2001 to 2003  Results show that deforestation was about 10 to 20 times less within the protected areas and indigenous lands than in adjoining areas  This demonstrates the importance of protected areas to hold back deforestation in these three states  refuting the widely held hypothesis that protected areas do not fulfill their main function in the conservation and sustainable use of resources in Amazonia
