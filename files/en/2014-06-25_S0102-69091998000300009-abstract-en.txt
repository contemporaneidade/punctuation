The article argues that the Wittgensteinian sociology of knowledge  which has been developed in the last thirty years  since Thomas Kuhn s seminal work  and has in such authors as David Bloor and Bruno Latour its main exponents  entails two untenable assumptions  First  that one can say something specially important about knowledge by investigating how people obtain  or fail to obtain  agreement on what one is justified in believing  Second  that the important thing regarding scientific theories is the fact that there are some people which are convinced of their validity  Such assumptions take one s attention away from the very important fact that scientific theories exhibit a trajectory in the course of time  which can be rationally reconstructed
