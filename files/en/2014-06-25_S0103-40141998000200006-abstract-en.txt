ALTHOUGH THE HISTORY of the Brazilian fossil coal started in 1975  when it first was discovered  it was only after the II World War that it began to reach the status of a modern industry  Since 1970 a proper geological exploration has improved the knowledge on coal deposits  There are eight large coal fields and several minor ones in the country  most of them  88  in the Rio Grande do Sul state  The geometric and physicochemical parameters of the main deposits are defined and presented in this paper  The world coal reserves correspond to about four times those of its major concurrents  oil and natural gas  and they have a better geographical spread  Thermoelectricity uses most of the Brazilian coal  cement  petrochemical  paper and cellulose plants as well as food and ceramic industries are usual consumers  The steel manufacturing industry was an important consumer in a recent past  but nowadays it totally relies on the imported coal  Brazil s balance of trade in 1996 showed a deficit of US  807 million and coal is the second commodity of the country s imports  More than a lack of money  the main difficulties of the coal industry were due to a technical and political misplanning that is indispensable to correct  before projecting new enterprises
