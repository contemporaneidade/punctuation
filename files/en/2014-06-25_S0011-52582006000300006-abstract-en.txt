The author discusses a municipal ordinance signed by the obscure mayor of a town in Rond nia State  Brazil  whereby he declares Jesus Christ the town s only Lord and Savior  in order to explain some of the tensions experienced by a country with a Republican political system undergoing the expansion of its democratic life  The argument is that the mayor  like more and more contemporary citizens  accesses the foundations for exercising the Republic without necessarily knowing their internal logical or historical development  On the other hand  neophytes grasp the Republican armamentarium with a vague and indeterminate meaning that is filled according to an imagination shaped by embodied skills
