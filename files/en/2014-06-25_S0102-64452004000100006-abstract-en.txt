The central issue discussed in this article is whether a judge has a legal duty to decide in an specific manner in cases of legal lacunae  to use H  L  A  Hart s expression  or in hard cases  to use Ronald Dworkin s expression  It argues that  though both Hart and Dworkin admit a weak form of judicial discretion  they hold opposite views on the existence of that duty  By adopting a notion of legal completeness  which may disagree with a social rule of recognition  and by including non conventional principles in the concept of Law  Dworkin offers the justification for that judicial duty  He also offers objective criteria of judicial decision even in hard cases
