While observing the city of Sao Paulo  it is easy to perceive that it has come to a real collapse  A dramatic inequality dominates  what makes that  at least  the third part of its population live in shameful conditions  At the same time  its economic power leverages an uninterrupted growth that paradoxically deepens its problems  pollution  floods  insecurity  precarious public transportation  and traffic jams are some of the  wounds  that characterize this city  What are the causes of this urban tragedy  They rely on the logic of the Patrimonialistic State  on a society that has never managed to overcome its slavery heritage  and on a state order that permanently consolidates the conservative modernization  And what could be the path to its solution  It demands a radical change in the logic of the city functioning  in the dynamics of the Patrimonialistic State which  in its turn  depends on profound and necessary individual changes
