Physics as philosophical practice points out the option of an approach which enables us to perceive fundamental features of physics  We maintain that the physicist and the philosopher play roles not so disjuncted and that the physicist s task is as much to enunciate the meaning of the concepts  establishing its logical and mathematic identification  as to link them to experience  With this point of view we analyze Einstein s activity with emphasis on the rise of Special Relativity Theory and the meaning of the concepts of Special and General Relativity  This analysis carries us to the thesis expressed in the title Einstein  philosopher  To this way we have needed to criticize that philosophical movement   Vienna s Circle   which was apparently the nearest one to Einstein s activity  However the Vienna s Circle only took him as physicist but not as philosopher  We analyze  and criticize  in particular Reichenbach s thesis on the separation between the context of justification and the context of discovery  this last one being left to the psychological camp  Through this criticism  we are looking  in discovery procedures  not a rigid logical structure but the larger notion of rationality
