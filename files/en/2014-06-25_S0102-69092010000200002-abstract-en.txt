The political culture of a peoples is a relevant aspect to understand the relationship they maintain toward its State  as well as their demands based on particular justice and democracy notions  In the Bolivian case  my approach will privilege two factors that help understanding cultural and political orientation of the indigenous majority   1  the argument around the right to cultivate coca leaf  even if it goes against international and national legislation  and  2  the present influence on political action standards based on ancestral principles of pre Colombian Andean politics  My goal is to show how both long lasting structures and the implementation of international anti drug legislation influence the conformation of the Bolivian political culture
