In this essay  I discuss the presence of the categories rudeness and offence in the discourse on friendship produced by a group of middle class English people resident in London  The frequent reference to these categories  rather than to the so called positive emotions  reveals the tensions regarding the negotiation of personal space which crosscut this discourse  which in turn highlight the problematic space that friendship occupies within the field of social relations  This essay draws on the analytical tools of a pragmatic approach within the area known as  anthropology of emotions  developed in the last decade in the Unites States  If at first emotion concepts were mainly studied cross culturally  nowadays they are seen as discursive practices situated within the wider field of social relations and negotiations of power  As such  emotions cease to be treated as an internal  purely subjective experience  in order to be analysed as a discursive practice with external effects on both private and public spheres
