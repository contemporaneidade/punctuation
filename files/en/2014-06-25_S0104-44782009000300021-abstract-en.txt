In this essay we look at some research that has  within the last ten years  revisited the work of Positivism s founder  Augusto Comte  This return to his work has consisted of perceiving his work in its entirety and through its own internal logic  placing particular emphasis on his second great work  Syst me de politique positive  1851 1854  and its contributions for contemporary political and social thought  In order to make the novelty of this new research clearer  we present one of the standard narratives on Comte and Positivism   in this case  through the work of Anthony Giddens    we also go on to discuss the meaning of the term  Positivism  and the various theoretical currents that come together under this rubric
