The following work presents the pioneering role of Otto Maria Carpeaux as a mediator of the literature of the  two Spains    the peninsular and the exiled   shaped after the Republican government was defeated at the Spanish Civil War  To this end  it develops in two movements  it traces back some of the essays published by Carpeaux in the press and some of the links the author himself establishes between his education and his interest in the Spanish culture  The dialogue between these two movements allows us to delineate this humanist s profile  as well as that of the comparative thought that structures his critical production  always guided by ethics  by acute aesthetic criteria and by the search to understand the world in which he lived
