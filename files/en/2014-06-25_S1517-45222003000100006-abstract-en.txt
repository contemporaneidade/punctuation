This text examines the relationship between Anthony Giddens  social theory and the Third Way program  a moment when the author became a British New Labour intellectual  The aim is to show that  in building such program  the main elements for the critique of  orthodox democratic politics  are founded on that social theory  The globalization process is seen by the author as a new model of social integration  whose bonds go well beyond traditional borders of communities and nations  carrying a new sense of social and political organization that challenges current generations to rethink the very roots of democratic experience  That is the meaning of the Third Way program as well as that of Giddens  social theory  In a more general dimension  it should be noted that both the theory and its political program are outlined within the trend that seems to dominate the current scene  that is to say  the perception of a new sociological environment in which market induction is dominant as an ethical political center from which an encompassing redefinition of social  political and economic relations is processed both locally and globally
