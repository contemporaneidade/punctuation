The aim of this article is to discuss how the bodies that support the construction of the materiality of  crimes of child pornography  are constructed  mate rialized in the context of investigative police work  Assuming that there is no pre discursive bodily reality upon which social construction is realized  I suggest that the analytical operations carried out in relation to sex gender may be utilized to understand the artificiality of the division between physiological and social sexual maturity  puberty  In a wider sense  it can be used to interpret the process of visually differentiating and identifying bodies as physical attributes of age  These conceptual formulations gain materiality in the ethnographic description of the analyses carried out by police officers  who define the images that can be classified as being  pornographic  and the bodies which can be identified as  children  making explicit how a detective eye reciprocally constitutes the materiality of crime and the materiality of bodies  thereby pro ducing the bodies it governs
