For decades the conventional wisdom in Brazil has been that political parties do not matter in explaining the behavior of Brazilian voters  However  this scenario of low partisan identification contrasts with the observation that  at least for presidential elections  electoral competition has been structured around two party organizations  those of the PT and PSDB  The aim of this article is to demonstrate that  even if parties are in fact not internalized in terms of party identification  we are witnessing an important division between two principal political organizations in terms of party preference  reflecting the emergence of a bipartisan system at the national level  On the basis of responses of interviewees about the presidential elections in the CSES ESEB of 2002  2006  and 2010  we see that in these elections the electoral affinities for the PT and PSDB are some of the principle components of an explanation of the vote  This article also emphasizes that despite the fact that party preference is more pronounced as a means of candidate selection for those with a high degree of education  it is possible to observe that even among those with less education this variable is fundamental to explain the vote  providing evidence that even for voters with less knowledge of politics  the parties are helping to structure the voting decision
