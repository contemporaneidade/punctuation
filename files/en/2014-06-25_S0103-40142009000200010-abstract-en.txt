Reviewing the first months of 2009  it s surprising to see the Brazilian economy resistance over the international crisis  The decline on production and investment were intense  however  there has not been neither a foreign exchange crisis nor fiscal and financial system breakthrough  The government could apply anti cyclic policies  as tax cuts and interest reduction  helped by the actual large extend of tax collection and banks strength  after years of high interest rates  besides using the public banks and the public funds  valuable legacy instruments  Regarding the external side  the capital inflow is stimulated by the wider liquidity generate by the US recent monetary expansion policy  while the exports are due to China demand maintenance  with significant increase in basic commodities and decrease of manufactured products  The capacity of reacting to the crises is a great test for the Brazilian model of economic opening  in the same way that the difficulties to sustain the industrialized good exports and recovery of investment rates in the manufacturing activities are considerable challenges
