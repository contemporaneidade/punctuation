The Brazilian Energy Matrix is known to be one of the most renewable of the world  Due to the size of the oil reserves found in the Pre salt fields doubts are pointed if these energy and greenhouse gases  GHG  emissions pattern will remain  The scientific goal of this article is to identify the historical profile of the sector s fugitive GHG emissions due to the oil   gas production  refining and transportation in Brazil from 1990 to 2008  period of time before the Pre salt layer hydrocarbon resources exploration  Here we show that the total GHG emissions increased around 115  from 1990 to 2008   an annual emission increase of 8 2 million tCO2  However  the GHG intensity per ton oil equivalent produced was reduce by 32
