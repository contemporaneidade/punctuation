The present article focuses in the bibliographical review of the liaison between social relationships and seniors  health  as well as in the interpretation and understanding of this problem under the light of two theoretical approaches  a macro  centered in Emile Durkheim s Theory of Social Integration and other micro  centered in Peter Blau s Theory of Changes  with an emphasis in the Theory of Equity  The social integration  incidence of contacts  may have negative effects in a senior s health  however this has to be measured by the quality of the contacts  Some of the presented conclusions indicate that social relationships have an effect in health  in the sense that people  in the modern societies  expect reciprocity  When this is not possible  especially during the aging process  people feel dependent  and this can affect health in different ways  On the other hand  when people have health problems they experience a lack of balanced social relationships due to their incapacity to exchange in equal bases  Therefore  the author concludes that the link between social relationships and health in the senior population can be a reciprocal association
