During the waning decades of the twentieth century  two radically opposed cultural accounts of kinship emerged in the narratives of evolutionary psychology  on the one hand  and in those of the new reproductive and biogenetic technologies  on the other  Both are peculiarly inflected by a Euro American cultural obsession with choice  but they move in opposite directions  Whereas Marilyn Strathern  1992  has argued that the new reproductive technologies  enterprise up  nature   read as biology   dissolving it into a plethora of choices  I contend that evolutionary psychologists  enterprise down  culture   read as individual choice   dissolving it into natural sexual selection and innate psychological  mechanisms  While others have traced the cultural transformations engendered by the reproductive and biogenetic technologies  in this paper I attempt to untangle the web of analogies  assumptions  erasures  and imaginative leaps that make possible the  enterprising down  of culture in evolutionary psychology s reductive account of kinship and gender and to map some of the consequences of that account
