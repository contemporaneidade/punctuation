In this article  I draw on research carried out in Sweden  India  Colombia  Ecuador  Bolivia  Chile  and the United States between 1995 2004 to focus on what Laurel Kendall describes as  the plasticity as well as the power of idiomatic kinship  in the context of transnational adoption  In both Europe and North America  transnational adoptions  which have tended to be cross racial  in the sense that the majority of adopted children come from non European regions of the globe  complicate the project of  imitating nature  since in many of these adoptions  the  difference  between adopted child and parent is obvious  The adoptee from Asia  Africa  or Latin America in an Euro American home represents the ultimate paradox of belonging in a global context where transnationalism both affirms and breaches the borders of the nation state
