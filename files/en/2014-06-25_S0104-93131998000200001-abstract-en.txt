Through a discussion of Franz Boas s theory of primitive art  this article aims to establish a new approach to understanding and analyzing his work  taking as its backdrop the problematic relation between anthropological perspective s  and the specific domain of art and material culture  With this objective in mind  two aspects are emphasized  first  Boas s accentuation of the formal element within which artistic phenomena are delimited  an emphasis which reshapes primitive symbolism  secondly  his emphasis on stylistic patterning as a correlate of processual mechanisms of historico cultural syntheses  an approach which reformulates the question of imagination  Discussion of this theme reveals some of the epistemological and ontological foundations implicated in Boas s proposed methodology  It also re evaluates his critical position in relation to previous anthropological theories   in particular  social evolutionism   and demonstrates the originality of his bringing together of both history and science  as well as atomistic and holistic perspectives of culture
