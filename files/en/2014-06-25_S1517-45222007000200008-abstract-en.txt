The structure of power is not an abstraction  it is materialised in objective situations of possession of wealth  and is reproduced and consolidated thanks to political  social  and kinship networks  Networks of political power are defined in this article as connections of interest which basically involve businesspeople and political offices within the apparatus of the State  in the executive  the legislature  and the judiciary  as well as the other places of power seeking to secure advantages and privileges for their members  In addition to the ideology reinforcing their legitimacy  networks may use artifices like nepotism  clientelism and corruption  The state of Paran  is shown as an example of modernity and rationality  adhering to the values and practices of capitalism governed by the principles of impersonality and efficiency  This article will demonstrate that this is a myth by looking at the genealogy of the families currently holding power and wealth  but which have been associated to the dominant interests for nearly 300 years  Distinguished names in politics and the economy make up a urprising and intricate network of relations of family  kinship  and privilege that secures the structure of power in the most distinct economic and political scenarios
