China has arrived on the periphery of development  bringing with it a wide political and economic agenda  This marks a new phase in China s international projection and in the world system itself  What are the goals of this new New China in terms of international politics  There are many who claim that China entertains ambitions of world dominance  seeking to move into the position the United States has held in terms of planetary leadership  In a manifestation of what comes close to resembling sino phobia  a new version of the  yellow threat  there are those who argue that Chinese development seeks to concentrate world wealth  breaking up the economies of other nations of the world  In advancing the hypothesis that Peking has inaugurated a new stage in international politics  substituting the one in which the New China was struggling to regain sovereignty and development  we base our argument on the relationships that China has established with the African continent  The new New China  then  has begun to transform the world system itself  In this sense  we argue  China has sought to avoid hegemonies  whether that of the Unitied States or its own  If this were not so  its fate could turn out to be similar to that of Germany s  in the aftermath of two World Wars  Yet such strategies might not be feasible  since China must act today within the context of post World War diplomatic fluidity and an aging contemporary capitalism whose historic centers are in rapid decline
