This article discusses and matches some contemporary theories on the origin and dynamics of social recognition  such as Charles Taylor s  and sociocultural approaches to the subject of inequality  such as Pierre Bourdieu s and Reinhard Kreckel s  in order to apply them  in a modified and productive way  to central matters of peripheral modernity  such as the undercitizenship and the naturalization of inequality  Its aim is to develop an alternative conception to the patrimonialist and personalist approaches to the subject  as well as to short range and pragmatic perceptions  which are the result of the partition and fragmentation of knowledge  unconcerned about understanding a more embracing reality
