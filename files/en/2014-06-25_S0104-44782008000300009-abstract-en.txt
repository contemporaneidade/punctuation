The advent of liberal democratic discourse in Brazil occurred at the moment in which oligarchic forces brought together elements able to contest the Crown s preeminence over imperial political structures  However  the crown s position on the abolition of slavery generated a short circuit in the way in which  until this moment  liberalism and democracy had been articulated  In this regard  the contrast between Rui Barbosa and Joaquim Nabuco s positions is exemplary  Through a normative universalist position  Rui Barbosa followed liberal doctrine  running the risk of handing power over to the oligarchies  whereas Nabuco  through sociological analysis  advocated the Crown s  illustrated despotism  which he believed would be capable of breaking up oligarchic power and implementing necessary social reforms  Our article  through direct recourse to primary sources of documentation  analyzes this debate  Its purposes are not primarily to produce a detailed discussion of the differences between the two politicians through consideration of their individual personalities but to illustrate a broader issue that deals with the trajectory of building democracy in Brazil  Comparison of the discourse of both politicians illustrates the dilemma of placing priority on political or social reform within a context in which the two seem to be clearly mutually exclusive  Furthermore  the debate enables us to understand the impasses that emerge in the trajectory of democracy in Brazil  squeezed between oligarchic liberalism and an authoritarian broadening of public space
