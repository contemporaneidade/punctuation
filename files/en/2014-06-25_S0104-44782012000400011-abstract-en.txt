This article examines how the Federal Supreme Court  Supremo Tribunal Federal  STF  makes its decisions  We look specifically at the groups that emerge as judges set out to decide cases  Part of the literature that deals with the issue we address here has argued that there is a high level of personalism in Supreme Court judging  indicating that the court works more as a sum of individual votes than as a collegiate body  This is verified when we look at some of the single cases that have had the greatest repercussion  Yet does this also hold true when we look at a large volume of decisions and analyze them as a whole  In order to answer this question  we follow the path laid out by authors who raise questions as to whether the Supreme Court acts as a cohesive collegiate body  yet assert that  rather than a sum of individual votes  it should be seen as coming together around temporary alliances and exclusive ingroups or  cliques  formed in accordance with the president s nominations  This argument is tested through empirical analysis of the 1 277 Direct Unconstitutionality Suits judged by the Supreme Court between 1999 and 2006  Our major conclusion is that judges who have been nominated by the same president show more propensity to vote as a group that to split up their vote  and that the cohesion demonstrated by the judges who have been named by the same president is greater than the cohesion among members of the court in general  During the period we analyze  beyond coalitions  we were also able to identify two  cliques  one made up of judges named during the military regime and aligned with judges named by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and President Itamar Franco  and the other made up of three judges named by President Lula
