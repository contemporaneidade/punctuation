In this article  we make the argument that some of John Rawl s  disciples  reflecting on the principles of international justice  have taken a position that is more consistent with the spirit of his A Theory of Justice than the author himself has  Scholars such as Charles Beitz and Thomas Pogge defend mechanisms of international distributive justice that seem to be more in line with the cosmopolitanism of the  principle of difference  that can be found within A Theory of Justice than are other efforts that Rawls himself made in his later work  more oriented toward international issues  The Law of Peoples  More specifically  we maintain that Pogge and Beitz developed more solid arguments  the relativization of the principle of the absolute sovereignty of States and international transfer of natural resources  for transporting the  principle of difference  into the international arena than what can be found within Rawls  proposal on  the duty of aid  in The Law of Peoples  We thereby demonstrate that Rawls  disciples are more faithful to the cosmopolitan spirit at the international level than he himself was  for three reasons  their belief in a world community of fellow citizens within an international institutional structure  the idea that the global production of collective resources should be redistributed through a principle of dense distribution and  finally  the notion that redistribution that can only be just insofar as it demands the moral reform of international institutions  International Monetary Fund  World Trade Organization  World Bank  principle of sovereignty etc  in such a way as to improve the life conditions of world s poorest peoples  Thus  this article discusses the most progressive legacy of authors whom  in taking their inspiration from Rawls  developed arguments that were more adequate than his own for nourishing a cosmopolitan spirit within the international arena
