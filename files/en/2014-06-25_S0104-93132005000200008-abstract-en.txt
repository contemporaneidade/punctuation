The aim of this article is to explore the idea of illusio as formulated by Bourdieu  enriching his notion with theoretical contributions from psychoanalysis and the thinking of such distinct authors as Clifford Geertz and Cornelius Castoriadis  The text argues that the sociological reflection dubbed socioanalysis by Bourdieu is compatible with psychoanalysis insofar as the concept of illusio displays close affinities with the concept of sublimation
