Based on ethnographic fieldwork with a team of primatologists working in a small area of Brazilian Atlantic Forest  this paper engages with some of the classical issues in the anthropology of science  especially the ethnological interest in the relations between humans and non humans and the cosmological dynamics that shape this collective  The paper focuses on how the image and agency of the primates is constructed  woolly spider monkeys known as  8216 muriquis  or  8216 mono carvoeiros  and also analyzes their appropriation by primatological discourse culture  As well as tracing the relations forming this collective of humans and non humans  the text maps the variations composed of images  behaviours and transpecific performances
