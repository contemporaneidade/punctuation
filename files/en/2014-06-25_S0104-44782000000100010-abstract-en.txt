This article analyses M  Mauss s classic Essai sur le don  at the light of recent theoretical developments in Anthropology  It stresses Mauss s contribution to the understanding of the political dimension of gift exchange  as well as of its universality  ulteriorly demonstrated by C L vi Strauss to be constituted as a formal and abstract principle  not an empirical fact  Taking this principle as its starting point  the article evaluates the thesis that the gift is the foundation of human sociability and communication  as well as the presence  or absence  of the gift and its different modes of institucionalization in several capitalist and non capitalist societies that were analysed by Mauss
