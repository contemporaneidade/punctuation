This article focuses on the question of how communities are formed in the context of new religious movements  specifically the Raelian Movement  a religious group in which individualist values typical of a New Age self religion merge with both possible and impossible community formations  Identifying the family as a key element in the analysis of the relation between individual and community  this article discusses how the Raelian religious project   which takes the individual as a value and strongly rejects the Christian familiar configuration   is dissolved not in the absence of community formations  but in the shaping of community assemblages that are more volatile and less cohesive  but no less complex and viable as transnational communities mediated by the mass media
