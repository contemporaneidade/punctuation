This paper explores the main criteria used in researches in the field of online deliberation  Through an extensive literature review  we selected 59 articles that list indicators to assess discussions in the internet  In these articles were found  altogether  369 criteria  with an average of 6 25 per item and standard deviation of 2 69  In a second stage  the research effort is made to group these criteria into broad categories and connected to the deliberative principles  The criteria were summarized in eight categories  namely  Justification  Reciprocity  Reflexivity  Respect  Pluralism  Equality  Information and Topic  We conclude that despite the many criteria used  one cannot say there is an excessive dispersion at online deliberation studies  This result is linked to different deliberative democracy approaches  the difficult to operationalize the criterion  the need for specific criterion for different contexts and objects and  in many cases  the mere difference of taxonomy
