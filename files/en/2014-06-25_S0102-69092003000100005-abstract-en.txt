The paper is divided in two clearly distinct parts  In the first one  after discussing the notions of citizenship and quality of democracy  the results of a survey showing a weak propensity of the Portuguese population to exercise its citizenship rights are presented  The sociological correlates are predictable and they tend to confirm the tendency of strata with more education and social capital to concentrate in their hands the instruments of political participation and representation  On the contrary  the distance felt by the majority of the population towards political power does not depend on its social properties  In the second part  the results of a historical research accounting for such  power distance  from the standpoint of  real civil societies  are presented  In the course of the presentation  the research will be expanded to Brazil with the help of several authors who have discussed the issue of citizenship there  Two main elements are identified in the chain of effects accounting for deficits in the exercise of rights  mass illiteracy and the  administrative despotism  of the State  To conclude  popular strategies of resistance and adaptation to modernization  however negative in the light of the liberal notion of citizenship  such as the so called  amoral familism  are called upon in order to more fully account for the distance towards political power felt in Portugal and perhaps Brazil
