In this article  resulting from research about  cena das minas do rock  between 2007 and 2010  my intention was to present an ethnography about the paper publications by women involved in the  cena  known as fanzines or zines  Analyzing such publications I present a reflection on young women s expression manners and feminist practices  and how they find a particular language at zines  Meantime  I hope to contribute to the production of knowledge concerned with the way speeches and feminist practices are re appropriated by young women from the contexts where they were set  The bunch of analyzed zines comprehends 1996 to 2007 period and were produced by groups and women placed at quite diverse sites at the  cena  also giving accounts of the diversity that marks this political and cultural movement related to youth
