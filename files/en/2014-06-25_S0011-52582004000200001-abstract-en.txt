An analysis of the French prison system s ebullience since 2001 shows that to use incarceration as a social vacuum cleaner in order to rid society of the dregs resulting from the economic transformations of neoliberalism is in fact an aberration  Not only do French crimes rates fail to justify the boom in the country s prison population  but comparative criminology confirms that there is no correlation between the incarceration rate and the crime rate  Automatic recourse to confinement in order to quash urban disorder is a remedy that nearly always aggravates the ill it is supposed to cure  It reinforces economic marginalization  social alienation  and the convicts  feeling of injustice  since prisons disproportionately affect the economically and culturally most vulnerable social categories  It is unrealistic to treat misdemeanors with such a gross and ineffective instrument as imprisonment  and it is urgent to reconnect the discussion on delinquency to the broad social issue of this century that this discussion conceals  the emergence of de socialized wage earners  the social insecurity vector  and material and mental deterioration
