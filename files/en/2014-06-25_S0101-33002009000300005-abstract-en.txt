This paper examines forms of citizenship associated with contemporary urbanism  Focusing on three paradigmatic spaces  the gated enclave  the regulated squatter settlement and the camp  the authors argue that the landscape of urban citizenship is increasingly fragmented and divided  These geographies are constituted through multiple and competing sovereignties which  when territorially exercised  produce fiefdoms of regulation or zones of  no law  In order to understand these practices  the authors employ the conceptual framework of the  medieval city  This use of history as theory sheds light on particular types of urban citizenship  such as the  free town  or the  ethnic quarter  that were present at different moments of medievalism and that are congruent with current processes
