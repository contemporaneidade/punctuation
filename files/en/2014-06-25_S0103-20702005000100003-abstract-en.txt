I have intended  in this article  to investigate the connections between the higher education reformation and the aesthetic avant garde movement of the twenties in Argentina  I focused on the influence the reformist experience  specially its net of connections  interests and contacts  had over the avant garde movement  In order to do that I chose to analyze the Mart n Fierro  1924 1927  magazine showing that in between the magazine s cosmopolitan vocation and the search for a new cultural nationalism we can recognize a particular statement of the topic of Americanism  Rejecting the essentialist definition of what  being American  means  the Americanism  as a referential point  will be presented as one of the themes that have positively contributed to the solving of some of the dilemmas aroused by the aesthetic avant garde movement of the twenties
