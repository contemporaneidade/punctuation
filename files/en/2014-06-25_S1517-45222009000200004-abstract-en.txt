This article deals with comparative methodology  focused on the most different cases  and exposes the increasing usefulness of this method in today s world  which is characterized by the rise of globalization  The  most different cases  method was developed in the sixties  when structural functionalist approaches were privileged because they tended to show unicity or  at least  the uniformity of the trajectories of change or the development of the human societies  It was this method that demonstrated the usefulness of a methodological tool that emphasizes the plurality of social forms  such as religion  trade  conquest  labor  etc  This paper intends to define the comparative approaches  as regards the most different cases  within the context of the contemporary methodological debates on comparativism  The article then proposes a definition of globalization and the mechanisms that explain the changes in the conditions of comparison in a globalized world  In the end  it concludes with an assessment of the merits and limitations of the comparative approaches of the most different cases within the context of globalization
