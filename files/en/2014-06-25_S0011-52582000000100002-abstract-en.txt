The article discusses the limits and scope of neoclassic economic rationale in analyzing labor relations  with a special focus on positions that defend labor market deregulation and on the notion of employability  Based on a rigorous critique of the presuppositions underlying these different notions  it is argued that the hegemony of the neoclassic approach to the world enjoys an arsenal that heavily constrains the arsenal available for interpreting Latin America 146 s social reality  Above all  it warns about the risks entailed in demands to undermine labor rights and re privatize class relations  as forced upon Latin America by neoliberal reform programs
