The idea that possession should be treated as a modality of practice has been found in a variety of forms in the works of a number of contemporary anthropologists  This article discusses a series of theoretical points central to understanding possession as practice  the questions of agency  the relations between body and meaning  and temporality  Pursuing a phenomenological approach  I attempt to show that any adequate treatment of these three questions requires that we attend to the temporal constitution of practice  in this case  possession  More specifically  I argue that failing to include temporality as a factor may seriously distort our analysis of possession  This thesis is developed through an examination of three case histories of possession in candombl  cults in Salvador  Bahia
