Since L vi Strauss  anthropologists have been trained to see the exchange rela tionship identified by Mauss in The Gift as a form of communication  Linguistics  reasoned L vi Strauss  holds the key to our understanding of society  This paper develops this anthropological interest in language by pursuing an altogether different approach  Applying Wittgenstein s idea that the meaning of a word is set by its use in actual situations  actual language games  the paper describes the rules for the language games played by politicians in the Brazilian Congress  The most striking of these rules is that politics should be understood as the exchange of material and immaterial things  following the same patterns of gift exchange explored by Mauss  Arguing that  at least in some contexts  the word itself is part of such exchanges  the paper aims to provide an ethnographical investigation of politics as the relationship between the exchange of words and the exchange of things
