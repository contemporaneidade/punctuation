This paper will attempt to evaluate  critically   some of the sacred and secular expressions of hope currently identifiable within many contemporary   post modern  societies  where  as one philosopher of religion has recently described it   all frameworks of narrative description embodied in their history and interpretation are currently dissolved in the acids of modernity  Particular attention will be paid to four distinctive yet interconnected contexts  where specific  strategies for hope    in both theory and praxis can be identified and evaluated These are  1  Urban regeneration and community development   symbolising and securing hope for a viable urban future  2  The Ecological Imperative   optimizing hope for the perpetuation of  Planet Earth  3  Re Sacralizing the Secular   re investing  post religious  secular social theory with overtly religious norms and values  4  The Aesthetic Imperative  utilizing the visual Arts  both elite and popular  as a mechanism for social and personal transformation  All four case studies embody explicit sources of  hope  for 21st century individuals  communities and societies  Yet all four also demonstate how the  cognitive distance  between  is  and  ought  between  rhetoric  and  reality  remains as visible  intractable and seemingly permanent as ever  Hence the re constitution of  hope  at the normative epicentre of post modern thought and action  although a theoretical possibility  may prove  in practice  little more than  Hoping against Hope
