The present article aims to provide theoretical and methodological basis to the concept of network applied to the study of Pentecostalism  Therefore  I will describe synthetically the research methods associated to network studies and their recent developments  In a first moment  along the 50  and the 60  it was unfolded an empirical approach based on description and analysis of observable relations on a limited territory  Currently  dialogues with History of Science  Philosophy and Geography allow us to rethink networks in a wide range scope  as a privileged locus in which we can study syncretism and new forms of territoriality  The analysis of transnational religious processes at Southern Latin America could be improved by the theoretical anchorage offered by these discussions
