Given the historical evolution of how one understands sustainability and considering their implications on the different uses of territory  this paper explores how these different approaches discuss and deal with the territory  Using the different settings to understand the continuities  changes and tendencies of the process  the text examines the creation of ecology as a science  followed by the emergence of moderate environmentalism  and finally more recent approaches such as political ecology  In the first part  the concept of sustainability is presented as it begins to be shaped by means of ideas of nature protection and conservation  typical of radical ecology  then  it discusses the more moderate version of the concept  when it was expressed in the conciliatory terms of environmentalism and evolves to sustainable development  and finally  the concept is analyzed as it changes into a means of social critique  when seen through the framework of political ecology  The second part the text argues that radical ecology  moderate environmentalism and political ecology face territorial sustainability depending on the various historical and environmental settings and visions of nature  It concludes that different views change depending on the geographical scales in which they engage and on what is at stake in each one of them  Considering the current environmental crisis  these views can present viable alternatives  given that they assign priority to specific aspects such as the natural landscape  nature society relations and socio environmental inequalities
