Drawing on ethnographic research in Mexico and Argentina  this essay addresses the promise  limits  and specificities of the generic pharmaceutical as a legal  technical  and political artifact  Attending to the complex commercial semiotics of  similarity  in Mexico  and to the powerful figure of the domestic copia in Argentina  I argue that at stake with the rise and expansion of markets for generic drugs is not simply a David and Goliath relationship between the  cheaper  accessible  democratizing  generic and the  expensive  patented original  Also central to a politics of the generic is the shifting line between the licit and the illicit copy  The essay thus poses the question  what are the implications of configuring a political language of  access  around the terms of intellectual property itself
