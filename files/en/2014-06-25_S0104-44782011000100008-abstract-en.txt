The social existence of individuals  for many of their interpreters   whether the latter resort to religious or political discourses or even certain currents of sociological thought   seems not to be possible without the existence of metanarratives that infuse it with meaning  This article engages in theoretical discussion of the discursive construction of those who act as their own entrepreneurs  as individuals capable of confronting quick and drastic changes occurring within the world of work with the advent of productive flexibilization  We advocate the hypothesis that this discursive construction does not portray a type of individual that is potentially accessible to all  insofar as it refers to a construction that does not involve the support of a shared societal project  In other words  we are looking at a type of individual who is disconnected from social ties and lacking in any type of State  supplied social protection and therefore  cannot provide a universal standard of behavior for a society that seeks to attenuate social inequality
