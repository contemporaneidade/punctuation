The press of the River Plate region  especially of Uruguay  showed a hostile attitude against the Brazilian military movement of March 31  1964  depicting it to the public as a  gorilla coup  This reaction became more explicit in April as the members of the Brazilian Especial Mission to Uruguay landed in Montevideo  The Mission s aim was to obtain from the Uruguayan Government  through the exertion of strong pressure  the formal compromise of confining former president Goulart and his companions to a distant area from the Brazilian border  namely the Montevideo Department  in which it would be easier for the Uruguayan authorities to keep their activities under control  Confronted with the neighboring Republic s refusal to attend its demand  the Mission returned to Brazil  but  curiously enough  taking home what it was not looking for  the recognition of the new Government  which was obtained from the National Council of Government by a scant majority of votes and under strong opposition on the part of the Uruguayan press and public opinion
