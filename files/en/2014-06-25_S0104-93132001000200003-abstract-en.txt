Assuming that processes of segmentation are not necessarily opposed to those linked to the state  this article seeks to explore the ways through which the segmentary divisions characteristic of Black Movement groups in Ilh us can function simultaneously as forms of resistance and as nodal points for mechanisms which are dependent on a state logic  It is a matter of emphasising both the processes of  capture  used by the state and the resistances mobilized by the segmentary formations  From a theoretical perspective  the aim of the article is to show that the application to our own society of categories traditionally developed to account for other cultures should cease to be a simple metaphor or stylistic resource and become an instrument of observation and interpretation  For this to be achieved  these categories must be transformed and made flexible  which also produces effects on the analysis of these  other cultures
