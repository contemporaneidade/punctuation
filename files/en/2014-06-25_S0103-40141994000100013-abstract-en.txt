The author reports on proclaimed crises in classical physiology as well as in the so called comparative animal physiology  In the former  the crisis would derive from loosing grond to biophysics  biochemistry  pharmacology and  even  immunology in a manner detrimental to holistic and systemic views  lack of opportunity to do cutting edge research is also pointed  In the latter  the trends followed in the researches would be far from the purpose originally conceived of subsidizing the phylogenetic analyses based on comparative anatomy  embryology and paleontology  The author emphasizes the undiminished importance of classic physiology  of which biophysics and biochemistry are but specialized branches and recalls that the holistic view and the systemic approach remain as the ultimate goal of physiology  As to comparative physiology  claims of failure to accomplish the alleged original purpose are to be rejected  in view of sucesses reported in tracing the evolution of functions and the fact that  with time  comparative physiology gained new connotations  mostly ecological  dealing with convergences rather than phylogenetic alignments  Besides  this branch of physiology has continuously furnished animal models for basic research  Thus  there would be no crises in a philosophical sense of loss of objectives or paradigm change  but rather a growth crisis towards molecular approaches  Essentially  not new trends  but new experimental designs  A brief reference to the prevalent positivist character of physiology is also made
