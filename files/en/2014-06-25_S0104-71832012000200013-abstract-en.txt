In this article  my proposal is to reflect about my participation in a judgment against six policemen  which had happened in La Plata city in Argentina  From the point of view of my engagement as a  witness  and from the observation of the session  I had identified the confluence of three kinds of knowledge  the anthropological  the juridical and the judicial  From that distinction  it will be suggested to think about the relation between facts and law as being specific from different types of knowledge  and furthermore having different levels of legitimacy and likelihood in the judicial context  My goal is to demonstrate that  in that judgment  the anthropological  the judicial and the juridical knowledge present legal sensibilities related to the positions and interests being defended  and to the specifics actions that they represent
