The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the existence of historical evidence that allows us to establish relationships between the concepts of free trade and protectionism  which are both used in US foreign trade policy  At the same  it seeks to demonstrate the importance of legislation and of the principles formulated in that country  as well as their role in explaining the motivation behind the structure of international trade after 1945  This explanatory role contributes decisively toward our understanding of the successive rounds of GATT  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  negotiations until the creation of the World Trade Organization  WTO  in 1995  Furthermore  it shows why US foreign trade is  beyond a matter of the State  a matter of society
