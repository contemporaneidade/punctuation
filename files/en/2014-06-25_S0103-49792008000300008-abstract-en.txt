Does diaspora imply a homeland  For a number of scholars who pioneered the growth of diasporic studies in the 1990s this was the sine qua non of the concept  Under the weight of social constructionist critics  who sought to deconstruct the foundational ideas of homeland and community  more complex and vaguer ideas of homeland and home emerged  These are characterized here as  solid   ductile  and  liquid  on a diminishing scale from historical reality to postmodern virtuality  I show that all three versions of home homeland have some historical and empirical support  but I reject the pure social construcionism  There is also some evidence that solid notions homeland are gaining increasing attention
