IN 2001  a law obliging the institutions of higher learning of the State of Rio de Janeiro to reserve 40  of all places for  blacks and browns  was passed by acclamation and without debate  Along the path of the preparations for the III United Nations World Conference against Racism  which was held in Durban in 2001  this policy and other similar ones decreed by the federal government came into being without ample public debate  Ex post facto this debate is now only beginning  The authors analyze the sequence of this radical change in Brazil s racial paradigm through a description of readers  letters published in the newspaper O Globo  These readers  our  natives  lead us to evaluate the difficulties and the consequences that this government policy imposes on the Brazilian population  especially those poorer citizens  who  far from the power elites  will now be obliged to define themselves  racially  in order to be treated unequally in the battle for places in the civil service and public universities
