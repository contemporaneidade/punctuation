The main goal is to demonstrate how G 7 countries control IMF s bureaucracy hiring process  We also discuss the political implications of such hiring process to the debate on IMF s reforms  We claim that such process bias IMF bureaucracy towards G 7 preferences  especially the USA  due to rules that favor only a limited group of grad school of economics at the hiring process  The political consequences of such rules is that reforming the IMF  from a developing country perspective  cannot be focused only on quota reforms  The hiring process should also be changed favoring economists coming from a more broad range of schools  especially from developing countries
