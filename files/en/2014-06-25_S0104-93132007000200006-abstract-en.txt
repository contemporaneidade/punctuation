In this article  I examine the functioning of the Local Information Commissions  LICs  set up in France as a way of liaising between representatives of nuclear facilities and local populations  enabling the latter to monitor the operation of these plants  I argue that creation of the LICs allowed the management of both distrust  harboured by the population vis vis the nuclear plants  and technological risk  posed by the plant to its neighbourhood  through the use of criteria selected by their participants   neutrality   independence  and  disinterested action  These criteria are deemed fundamental in terms of the success of the communication between the company and the general public  especially in a context riven by the conflict  very often described as a  war  between supporters and promoters of the nuclear industry and those campaigning against it
