This article raises several issues for critical debate on the reform of the Brazilian electrical sector during the 1990s  We relate endogenous and exogenous factors  which are methodologically connected through an historical structural approach that links Brazilian industrialization processes to international economic dynamics  Thus  the neo liberal reforms of the decade of the 1990s are seen in the context of the wave of liberalizations promoted in connection with globalization processes  in which the dynamics of capitalism   linked to the expansion of finance capital   has led to the shrinking of nation states  In this regard  the Brazilian electrical sector can be considered exemplary  its privatization process  planned through consideration of economic and financial issues alone  relegated concerns for consumers  needs to a secondary level  thus causing problems related to citizenship and eventually provoking difficulties of supply to the population
