AS THE possibility of therapeutic cloning in humans has just been demonstrated by a Corean group of researchers  the paper argues that biotechnologies of that kind may contribute to alleviate the chronic shortage of organs and tissues for transplantation  Ever since immunosuppressant drugs have become available  transplantation surgery has made considerable progress  and the procurement of transplants  especially from living donors  has been problematic  The investigation of the properties of  adult or embryonic  stem cells opened great hopes  Conditions such as diabetes  multiple sclerosis  myocardial infarct  or neurodegenerative diseases  Parkinson s  Alzheimer s  Huntington s diseases  could be treated by cellular therapy  namely  transplantation of human cells issued from cell lines derived from human stem cells possibly stored in cell banks  Adult stem cells  however  are rare and difficult to identify  apart from bone marrow  which contains the precursors of blood cells  a resource already widely used  There exists a large supply of human embryonic stem cells in countries where the freezing of embryos for the purposes of medically assisted procreation leaves  spare  or  surplus  embryos which may be either destroyed or donated for research after couples have fulfilled their procreative aim  It is often considered that harvesting stem cells from those embryos  for use in research or therapeutics  is morally more acceptable than destroying them  But the constitution of stem cell banks is open to two objections  First  in order to offer HLA compatible grafts to a large population  the bank should offer a selection of cell supplies representative of all HLA types in the population  a virtually impossible task  Second  with HLA compatible grafts there remains a risk of immunorejection  and a necessity for the patients treated to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives  Should biological research establish their feasibility and safety  cloning techniques might then appear to be the best choice  Treating  for example  diabetic patients with cells constructed by transferring the nucleus of a somatic cell of the patient into an enucleated oocyte would have the double advantage that the graft would be immunocompatible with the receiver  and that cell banks would not be required  instrumentalizing women for the collection of oocytes has been found objectionable  but a Chinese group of researchers suggested the possibility of using animal oocytes  It remains that such practices have raised lots of ethical controversies  It is at this moment difficult to assess their impact on our vision of  humanity
