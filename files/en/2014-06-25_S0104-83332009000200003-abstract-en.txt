In this essay  I argue that the concept of masculinity that was first developed in Bateson s Naven  his 1936 monograph about ritual and society among the Iatmul  a New Guinea people  was an originary moment for the constructivist position that has come to hold sway  not only over masculinity studies in Melanesia in specific  but over masculinity studies in general  My thesis  however  advances a more definite claim  Bateson s prescient view of gender did not come to theoretical maturity in masculinity studies  either areally  or more broadly defined  for another 50 years  when it was given new articulation by Marilyn Strathern in The Gender of the Gift  1988
