Reflecting on a decade and a half of ethnographic fieldwork  this article examines the lessons learned while attempting to scrutinize the political dynamics among the urban poor  It begins with an analysis of the limitations of the concept of political clientelism to understand what really goes on when votes are  exchanged  for resources  It then studies the recursive relationship between patronage and collective action   two political phenomena typically seen as antagonistic to each other  The paper then elaborates on the notion of  the gray zone    as the area of clandestine connections between perpetrators of violence and established political authorities  The article finishes with an examination of two themes that have been surprisingly absent in the research on the urban poor  environmental suffering and the politics of waiting
