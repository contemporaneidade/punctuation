The authors analyze voters  use of blogs and Orkut  the most popular on line social portal in Brazil  during the 2008 municipal elections in S o Paulo  In addition to analysis of these sites  two researches on voters  main sources of information  carried out by Ibope Intelligence  are also used  Results show that in Brazil the internet is a communication channel with limited outreach in quantitative terms  particularly if we compare it to the last U S  elections  yet it provides important possibilities for mobilizing and engaging those voters who are most politically involved  particularly the younger ones  Nonetheless  in spite of the diversity of sources of information offered by the web  communities tend to connect up only to sites and communities holding similar opinions while rejecting those that manifest divergent positions  This can create lesser access to plurality among voters who use only on line communities and blogs as sources of campaign information
