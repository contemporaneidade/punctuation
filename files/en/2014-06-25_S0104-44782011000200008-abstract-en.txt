This paper addresses problems in the theory and practice of democracy  In the twentieth century new economic and sociological theories of rationality came to dominate social science  These theories undermined old ideals of representative democracy  For a while  the bureaucratic paradigm seemed to offer a solution  But by the 1980s bureaucracy was derided as inefficient and unresponsive  How should we address the resulting problems of democratic governance  Policy actors have responded by clinging to the old ideal of representative democracy buttressed by forms of expertise based on the new theories of rationality  A new governance of markets and networks thus has spread across the world  So  representative governments still struggle to direct the policy process while an illusory expertise crowds out democratic participation  Contemporary democracy suffers from both blurred lines of accountability and declining legitimacy  The paper concludes by suggesting that democratic renewal may depend on more interpretive styles of expertise  dialogic forms of policy making  and diverse avenues for public participation
