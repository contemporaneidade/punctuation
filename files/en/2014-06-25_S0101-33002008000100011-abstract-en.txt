Looking back at the issue of a lecture given at Pinacoteca do Estado  S o Paulo  Brazil  in 2003  this article  based on the analysis of Tropical  canvas painted by Anita Malfatti in 1917  proposes that the artist  contrary to what has traditionally been stated  was undergoing a change in her pictorial language  distancing herself from the vanguard conceptions she had been embracing up to that date  In so doing  she would align with the international trend of the Rappel   l ordre and approach the discussions on nationalism in art  present in the art millieu of S o Paulo city  Thus  the image of an insecure woman who changed her perspective because of the famous review by Monteiro Lobato  acquires another connotation  Modernists would have preferred  and reiterated  this interpretation instead of making an analysis of Anita Malfatti s work per se  through which a volunteer desertion from the vanguard program could be unveiled
