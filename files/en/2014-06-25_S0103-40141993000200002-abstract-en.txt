With the end of state socialism in Europe  neoliberalism is presented as an universal solution  but it can not resolve many practical problems and its  miracles  are very problematic  because of low salaries  asymmetrical exchanges  artificial credits and ecological destruction  Its theory can not elaborate the structural contradictions of capitalism  Economy is internationalised  it is growing up a general crisis  The United States can not be again the locomotive of international economy  because its private debt has duplicated in the last 10 years and reacches in average  70 000 per family and export can just be maintained with the devaluation of the dollar  Japan and Germany have developed through artificial credits  without a proportional increase in production  The latin american countries could not increase their participation in the international market like the asiatic tigers  but those can not serve them as models  Brazil is not like Corea  has not a very developed neighbour like Japan  has a bigger population and a potentially great internal market  The theories of dependence have insisted on the asymmetrical exchanges  but have not considered enough the intrinsical contradictions and limits of capitalism  So  many dependentists are now defending the theories and practice of neoliberalism  Nowadays it is difficult to think an alternative model to the dominant neoliberalism  but its failure makes it necessary
