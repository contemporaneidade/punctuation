Most economists and government leaders stated that the crisis was not going to reach Latin America  the indicators of vulnerability have improved in most of these economies  However  the crisis did reach the region and is looking increasingly severe as the days go by  The indicators of economic vulnerability alone cannot  therefore  establish reliable forecasts  More reliable indicators such as exchange rate appreciation and other high inequalities must also be taken into account  The worse these indicators are  the more difficult it is not to fall into the crisis  and vice versa  In developed countries  the crisis has taken on a systematic character and the signs of fragility are worrying  Therefore  despite an improvement in the indicators of economic vulnerability  the crisis will have significant repercussions in emerging economies
