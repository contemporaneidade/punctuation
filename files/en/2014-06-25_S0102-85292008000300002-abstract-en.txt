Why most trade disputes in the World Trade Organization  WTO  end in a friendly settlement  despite the existence of a sophisticated dispute settlement mechanism  How can we explain the complainant s preference for a friendly settlement when we know that the WTO decides 64  of the cases in favor of the complainant  In this article I discuss patterns of settlement in the GATT WTO system using theory of moves  BRAMS  1994  to study the strategic choices available to disputants  I suggest that in the WTO system complainants act magnanimously  thereby bypassing their best outcome in a game  This is rational on their part because it offers defendants more opportunity to settle  which is beneficial to both sides  This behavior is not well explained by the myopic equilibrium concepts of standard game theory  By contrast  theory of moves incorporates non myopic reasoning into its model of decision making  In particular  I explain why it is rational for players to act non myopically on occasion and move to their second best outcome in a game  Three case studies illustrate the analysis  i  when settlement follows magnanimity   ii  when settlement occurs regardless of magnanimity  and  iii  when there is no settlement  These three outcomes exhaust the empirical record of WTO disputes
