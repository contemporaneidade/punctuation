This article aims at investigating the ways whereby nature is operated in some of Gilberto Freyre s and Roberto DaMatta s interpretative endeavors on the Brazilian societal experience  I contend that Freyre and DaMatta converge towards a similar epistemological framework which tends to envision contemporary Brazil as a singular case in contrast to other modern societal scenarios  Last but not least  I test the hypothesis according to which both Freyre and DaMatta put forth a combination of nature with social variables that ultimately tend to reinforce the diagnosis of Brazil as a unique modern case
