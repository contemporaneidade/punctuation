This paper reflects on the traditional teaching of social sciences in Brazil based on a previous diagnosis of its excessive focus on classical sociology and on scholarship to the detriment of empirical research  Second  we seek to analyze the teaching of social sciences methodology in the country  which is permeated by a false opposition between quantitative and qualitative techniques  These latter  further  are raised to the status of different  and even conflicting  methods  Such methodological war is often ended by the defeat of the supposed  quantitative method  to which epistemological problems of origin and even ideological contents are associated  In this context  the term  positivist  is typically used as a kind of methodological insult  rather than referring to an actual epistemological theory  For the winner methodological perspective research would be rather an art than an enterprise subjected to objective and strict validity criteria  Such a context allows that other professionals as economists and statisticians come to occupy  in practice  the space neglected by social scientists
