In the last years  both research and debates concerning public policy evaluation have clearly been marked by a specific normative bias and by an emphasis upon the technical aspects of evaluation  as well as by the valorization of its role as a management tool  Recognizing the incipient character of both the research and the practice of public policy evaluation in Brazil  this paper has the following objectives   1  to analyze the aspects that have justified and conditioned the generalized implementation of public policy evaluation systems  particularly in Latin America   2  to discuss the reasons behind the prevalence  both in the state and in the analytical level  of a  technicist  conception of evaluation  which is regarded today almost exclusively as an instrument to be used by the public managers  and  3  to emphasize the essentially political character of public policy evaluation  listing and categorizing the distinct forms of its utilization  The virtual subordination of the management use of evaluation to broader political projects and to specific strategies and interests of decision makers and other stakeholders will be stressed
