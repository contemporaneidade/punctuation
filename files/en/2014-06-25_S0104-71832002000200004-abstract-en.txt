The present article defends the idea that we should subvert the usual procedure used to study the social genesis of techniques  The issue of the social genesis of techniques should be studied by considering  first and foremost  that which is conventionally called  technical choices  Habitually  tautological explanations are given in an attempt to explain the adaptive advantages that make a certain technique necessarily emerge  Rather than offering such explanations  the negative determinants for a technological choice are examined here  Negative determinants are sought with questions such as why did such technique not appear in that particular context where it could have possibly appeared  Any technique may be thought of as a relationship between man and the inorganic or live matter  which he himself is a part of  If so  then such a relationship can be objectified  that is  it can be represented with preexistent relationships considered possible in a given cultural group  This idea regarding technique is illustrated here with an explanation for the rejection by the Amazon Amerindian populations of animal domestication
