In this article we revisit a famous chapter of Brazilian history  yet to be properly analysed from an ethnological perspective  the  Tamoio confederation  a coalition of 16th century coastal Tupian groups who threatened to undermine Portuguese colonization during the dispute between the French and Portuguese for the Guanabara region  now Rio de Janeiro  Was this  confederation  a new phenomenon in Tupian politics  engendered by the Conquest and inducing a shift towards political centralization  Or was it  on the contrary  the actualization of a possibility already  always  present in Tupian forms of political organization and action  These are the questions guiding our inquiry  which we seek to answer through the use of both historical sources and the in depth ethnological knowledge of Tupi Guarani peoples developed by various authors over recent decades
