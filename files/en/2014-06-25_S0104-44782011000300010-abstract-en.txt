This article analyzes the effects of the new drug law on legal repression of drug use and formal trial of cases that appear before the criminal justice system  We seek to understand the practice of the actors involved in social and legal control of drug use and to elucidate the dynamics of negotiations of criminal charges against users  in light of the debate on the changes brought about by new legislation  There has been a reduction in the number of criminal charges related to drug use  something which cannot explained by legal changes alone by the notion that this crime has gained new interpretation  We argue here that the lack of interest in criminal charges for drug use has left it in the hands of the military police who ostentively patrol city streets  They have gained an implicit mandate to negotiate whether users are arrested or not  and even acquire influence over what type of penal classification is imputed  The imprecise nature of the legal criteria employed to distinguish users and dealers  together with the immense disparity in the sentences given for these crimes which the new law accentuates  contribute to informal negotiation of greater or lesser charges and reifies police stereoptypes  favoring arbitrariness  This indefinition is not a result of imprecise law  but of the empirical impossibility to draw a clear cut line between types of classifications
