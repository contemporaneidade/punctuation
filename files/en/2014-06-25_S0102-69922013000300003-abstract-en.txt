The working time is a central concept to the Marxist analysis of capitalist society  From Karl Marx to the present day  the discussion on the reduction of working time has been developed by several interpretations  Among them is one that points to the gradual reduction of working time  Progressive  this case is not understood on the basis of its own contradiction  in other words  as a need of capital for their valorization  but as a process of progressive reduction of working time that  ultimately  put the capital relation in check  Based on this interpretation  the trend of reduction of working time would announce the extinction of capitalist relations of production  We would  therefore  faced with a perspective that is grounded in a social automatism and therefore assumes the end of capitalism in a deterministic way  Returning to the more central implications that the restructuring process  called toyotist  has provided  especially those relating to the massive replacement of workers by informational technology and microelectronic  this article aims to revisit the notion of working time  trying thereby to demonstrate the fragility of the thesis that assumes a structural breakdown of capitalist society as the result of an automatic internal movement of capital reproduction  We conclude that these theories in practice mystify the centrality of class struggle  first as a determinant element of the constitution of capitalist productive forces  and second  as an overcoming element for the subordination of labor to capital
