This paper describes the ethnographic records of the C rio de Nazar  Feast  in Bel m  Par  indicating that the promotion of this event has since brokered diversified bases of identity  generating circuits and flows that converge to a complex and diffuse ritual  This promotion has tensioned the roles of social and religious local actors who seek to take of this religious and devotional good and promoting events that complement the dynamic of the Feast  Such appropriations show assemblages and conflicts that go beyond the religious sphere itself  but revolve around the central ritual of the Feast of C rio  Form is thus a field of negotiations on the appropriations of the event  establishing a social imperative performance that guides the projects of the actors  such as assemblages of religiosity
