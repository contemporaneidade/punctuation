This article presents the disagreements I ve noticed during the field research conducted in Bosnia regarding the representation of the difference and the meaning of the war  In Sarajevo  it s possible to notice a nonconformist view about the current situation in Bosnia  Sarajevo has always been perceived as a symbol of tolerance  The Agreement for peace stopped the war by dividing the territory into two entities   the Federation and the Republika Srpska  It s considered that this agreement have institutionalized national differences  serving as an award to the  aggressors  and to their ethnic cleansing and genocidal policy  At Republika Srpska  this same agreement established an autonomous Serbian entity within the Bosnia  Unlike of an  award to the aggressors  here it s been considered as a consequence of a civil war which couldn t end in another way  Following the different interpretations concerning the meaning of the war  different histories and truths have been created
