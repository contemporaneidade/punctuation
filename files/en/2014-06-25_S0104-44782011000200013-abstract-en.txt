This article evaluates political party discipline within the Brazilian legislature and the support that is provided to the government  from the perspective of a bi  dual  chamber system  I have two major objectives The first one involves including the Senate in discussion of the relationship between Executive and Legislative powers in Brazil  comparing it to the House of Representatives  In the second place  I seek to evaluate parties individually  taking their particular characteristics into consideration rather than regarding them as inherent to the political party system  My analysis has focused on the nominal voting carried out in the House of Representatives and the Federal Senate  in the period ranging from 1989 to 2008  comparing the behavior of one party to another as well as to itself  over time  A cross sectional and longitudinal approach enables us to observe results that were previously unidentified within the literature that deals with the relationship between the nation s Executive and Legislative powers  It also reinforces the argument that parties are cohesive  disciplined and predictable  yet are substantially different from one another in strategies and in terms of the type of relationships that they weave  Given the high level of fragmentation and the peculiar traits of each party  it does not seem appropriate to speak of systemic attributes that can be extended to all of them  and even less so when both seats of power are considered
