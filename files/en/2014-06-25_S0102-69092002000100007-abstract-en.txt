The article proposes a re reading  confessed to be interested and ironic  of the well known explanations rendered by Malinowski in the opening chapter of the Argonauts of the Western Pacific  In this text  Malinowski explains the reasons for the type of approach adopted to study a Melanesian population in the 1910s  which has ever since become the consecrated approach in Anthropology known by the idea of  fieldwork  The author intends to show that the same reasons used by Malinowski  placed within the propitiated framework by different objects  are able to base a different methodological approach  In this sense  to continue  faithful  to Malinowski means to re read  or even to subvert it  in ordet to explore certain vital aspects of the text  based on real research situations that anthropologists have come across at present time  This should allow the adequation of methodologies in the field that do not need to be strictly defined as  fieldwork  These reflections were defined after a personal trajectory characterized by researches using archive materials and textual sources
