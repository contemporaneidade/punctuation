Sociology and ecology are often turned to in the current search for answers to two dilemmas  the crisis of paradigms within the human sciences  a product of processes of rapid yet profound changes in our present industrial society  and crises between social organizations and their surrounding physical natural environment  The expectation that these fields will provide the answer may feed the notion that greater integration between disciplines will suffice to generate efficacious solutions to the problems underpinning these crises  On the one hand  it may seem a simple task to achieve the integration of two sciences displaying such surprising affinities  On the other  this integration can not be attained instantaneously but requires an open dialogue  where both fields are forced to make commitments and compromises and to exchange experiences
