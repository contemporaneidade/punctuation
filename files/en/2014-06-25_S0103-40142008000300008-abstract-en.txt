The authors present a short review on the evolution of malaria incidence in the Brazilian Amazon  with particular reference to the Rond nia State and the Municipality of Porto Velho  where dramatic epidemics of malaria and other tropical diseases have been registered in the past  Next  they analyze the present endemic malaria situation in the Madeira River Valley where two important Hydroelectric Power Plants will be constructed in the localities of Santo Ant nio and Jirau  Longitudinal surveys performed in the last four years in this area allow to demonstrate a high prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria carriers in the area  associated to the presence of high densities of the malaria vector Anopheles darlingi all over the year  These elements are correlated to the expected arrival of a large number of human migrants originated from non endemic areas of Rond nia and other Brazilian States  attracted by the possibility of jobs in the Hydroelectric Power Plants and by secondary opportunities in commerce  leisure  education and domestic activities  These associations create favorable conditions for malaria outbreaks and other tropical diseases that must be avoided by the establishment of additional control measures  in particular in the sanitation domain
