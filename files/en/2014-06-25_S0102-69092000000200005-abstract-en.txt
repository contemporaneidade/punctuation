Over the past few decades a process of construction and deconstruction of the concept of old age has been noticed in the western societies  a theme which has proved to be an object of further investigation and reflection in several fields of knowledge  Old age has equally become an object of increasing intervention  which is generated among different agencies and agents pertaining to the same trend  Thus  the production of legitimate discourses concerning old age has been followed by a number of actions that have been organized on some basic assumptions  In the academic field such a tendency has given rise to geriatricians  specialized doctors  and gerontologists  specialized non doctors  who have been both legitimated by the institutions they create  such as the prestigious Sociedade Brasileira de Geriatria e Gerontologia  SBGG  which holds scientific knowledge about old age  This paper presents some of the issues  which have arisen in a wider project on age categories  concerning the discourse and praxis of geriatricians and gerontologists  Such discourse and praxis are related to family topics in an attempt to clarify some of their non explicit assumptions  which guide their actions
