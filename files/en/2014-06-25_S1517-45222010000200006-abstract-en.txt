This paper proposes a typological model to provide further understanding of the connection between public policies and electoral dynamics in a federal democracy in which the power to formulate and implement public policies is relatively decentralized  More generally  this typology of public policies is intended to move beyond the traditional dichotomies of political science   clientelism vs  universalism   catch all parties vs  programmatic parties   offering a new analytical perspective  with a non dualistic approach  The typology classifies public policies according to two dimensions  the criteria for allocation of resources  partisan or universal  and the nature of the goods and services produced  private or public  From the intersection of the two dimensions  the paper defines four types of strategies for the implementation of public policies  clientelism  distributive policy  policy targeting and universalism  It also proposes some hypotheses to explain the choices of public policy made by the state governments  The article takes into account three types of explanatory factors  horizontal political competition  between political parties  vertical competition  between the spheres of government  and the socio economic and demographic context
