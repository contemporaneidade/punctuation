Mercury contamination in aquatic ecosystems in Brazil is discussed by comparing the biogeochemical characteristics resulting in increasing mobilization and bioavailability to food chains and eventually increasing human exposure to mercury  We compare key Amazonian systems and some estuaries  which due to the high complexing capacity of Hg by dissolved organic matter  maintain elevated concentrations of mercury under readily bioavailable forms  able to undertake methylation and biomagnification through food chains
