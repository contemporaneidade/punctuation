Considering the Nation State as the privilegied actor in International Relations since Westphalian System points a congenital esquizofreny  The International Relations classical principles   self determination and non intervention   sugests  by one side  a right of each State self determinate itself sovereingtly and  by other side  a right of not being object of intervention  The first right excludes  the second  includes  Just the State guarrantees its self determination and doing so  excludes the others  meanwhile the non intervention depends on the other States respect  The debate about human rights in International Relations follows the same logic  Cosmopolitans defends inclusion  comunitarians  exclusion  These are rights that exlcude each other and make the International Relations something esquizofrenic  Rawls tries to work out this dilemma  but he fails  The proposal may be thinking International Relations from another point of view  from post modernism  by which we think the satisfaction of human global demands that overcome the national boundaries made in Westphalia by a political configuration other than the Nation State
