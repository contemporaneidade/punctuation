The purpose of this article is to analyze the use of the philosophical notion of antagonism within the context of Political Science  Its theoretical and epistemological framework pertains to the arena of Discourse Theory  as developed primarily by Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe  starting with their now classic 1985 work  Hegemony and Socialist Strategy   Towards a Radical Democratic Politics  If rigorously considered from a philosophical point of view  the notion of antagonism is sometimes employed by these authors in a generic and imprecise way  We contend that not only is antagonism responsible for the impossibility of a complete closure of the meanings of a discourse  but the very self referential way in which its structures work maintain a constant discursive  opening  Consequently  what we call the  double impossibility of complete discursive constitution    due both to what is lacking and what is amply present emerges
