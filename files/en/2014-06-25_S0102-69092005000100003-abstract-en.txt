From the point of view of my own research among the Yaminawa of the Acre River  this paper examines the latest historiography on the indigenous peoples in Brazil   a rather new discipline  since these peoples were viewed as  out of history  not long ago  It brings some questions on the role that the historicity of indigenes plays in the broader theoretical frame of anthropology  Does it tell us anything new about  natives  or about this anthropology that has been leaned  more or less explicitly  in the distinction between humanity  with  and  without  history  Have we either faced the dissolution of another false dichotomy or perhaps such dichotomy used to be too much productive not to have disappeared without leaving behind a profound modification of its terms
