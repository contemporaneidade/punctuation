This article discusses the contributions that social network analysis makes to contemporary social movement theory  Based on a theoretical review of consecrated conceptions in the study of collective action  we examine the limitations of three concepts in relation to contemporary collective actors and practices  1  social movement organization  2  structures of political opportunity  3  collective action frames  We argue that the social network approach makes a fertile contribution to social movement theory  proposing broad and dynamic research that allows recognition of the multiple facets of collective action  Social network analysis makes it possible to reconstruct the dense and complex relational fabric that structures the relations that unfold among social actors within specific groups and organizations and with the movement  as well as the relationships that the former maintain with political and institutional actors
