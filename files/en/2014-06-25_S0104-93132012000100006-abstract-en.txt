Here we evoke the general lines of development of the author s academic work  which has been dedicated to the elaboration of two theories with regard to American societies  a sociological theory  that establishes ties of affinity as the generic scheme for indigenous social relations  and a cosmological theory that proposes to redistribute the values western metaphysics attribute to the catego ries of Nature and Culture  We then examine the three basic actional schemes of the key concept of  transformation  within anthropological discourse  an  accusatorial  scheme  an  ergative  scheme and a  reflexive  scheme  The last of these three schemes opens the way for a symmetrical or reverse anthropology that allows us to create an effective gene ralization of the discipline s project
