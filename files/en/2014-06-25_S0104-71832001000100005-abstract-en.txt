The essay presents  firstly  a review of anthropological theory  assessing its role in the context of contemporary theoretical developments in the Humanities  To do so  I developed the metaphor of the metamorphoses of the ethnographic eye  which allowed me to detect some crucial moments of the reception and reproduction  in peripheral countries such as Brazil  of this knowledge created in metropolitan places in the days of colonialism  Secondly  I review the ideas of some leading theorists of postcolonial and subaltern studies  such as Edward Said  Gayatri Spivak and Homi Bhabha  Thirdly  I discuss the possibilities of a postcolonial ethnography  aimed at the narration of subaltern voices  which puts Anthropology close to Comparative Literature  Finally  I illustrate these discussions with the presentation of an extraordinary narrative of a woman gatherer of baba u coconut from Maranh o  I compare her text with Heidegger s reading of one of H lderlin s poems on the subject of unhomeliness  This crossing of texts opens a wide range of references about the condition of homelessness which affects us all  both our so called natives and ourselves  ethnographers and intellectuals of peripheral nations of the world system
