The article discusses the contribution of P  Bourdieu to a sociology of aesthetics  examining in particular his concept of a  literary field  Initially the advantages of the bourdieusian position over an ingenuous understanding of literary text  that views the latter only as the product of a creative individuality  are presented  Subsequently  however  it is argued that the literary text presents an  excess of meaning  that the author appears to have difficulty in capturing because  in his conception  the work is too closely linked to the immediate social context of its originator or originators  The article eventually proposes that the best moments of his provocative contribution must be united to the work of other thinkers  such as W  Benjamin  that also questions the relevance of the literary text as a productive source for understanding a particular historical period
