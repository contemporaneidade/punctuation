In this paper  I claim that metaphor and concept are names for the same kind of thing  And if this is so  metaphor is a metaphor for concept  concept is a metaphor for metaphor  An archeology of metaphorical knowledge is a metaphorical expression for a set of claims and procedures designed to expose the buried assumptions and associations constituting  and by constituting  regulating  what we think we know  The affective and normative resonances of metaphors related to  community  speak to a deep yearning in a world where communities no longer resemble what they once did   International community  is an above ground archeological site  as prominent as it is unexplored  Its excavation may take us to some distant past only to bring us back to the very world we live in
