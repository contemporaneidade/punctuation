This paper discusses the premises of the deliberative model of democracy as they address the issue of political participation  We attempt to clarify what political participation means for those who use this model  while at the same time looking at some of the major critiques that have been directed toward it  Through a review of an important part of the literature  and without losing sight of earlier systematizations of democratic theory  three fundamental conditions for engendering participation according to this discursive model are pointed to  political institutions should create and offer citizens opportunities to participate in public input  improvement in people s socio economic condition must be made  attention should be given to particular principles that have consistent regulatory influence on the interactions and arguments in question  This is followed by attention to the criticisms raised and flaws detected by deliberationism s detractors  At the end of the text  a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the model is presented  along with a discussion of the problem of participation in contemporary democracies
