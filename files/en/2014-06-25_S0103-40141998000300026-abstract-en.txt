THIS PAPER is an attempt at analysing a poem by Manuel Bandeira  called Lua Nova  composed in 1953 in Rio de Janeiro  Reading the verses in the light of some Dilthey s reflections  I look for the expression of the poet s experiences  then trying to understand  through Lua Nova  his constant refusal of all excess and his serene acceptance of life s rhythm  which contains as an inevitable and deeply significant end death itself
