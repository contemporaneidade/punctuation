I intend to reflect on some possible approaches on football from an ethnographic experience in a neighborhood located in the rural perimeter of S o Bento do Sapuca   SP  where I investigated the possible interlacements between associative forms and sociability around football and the universe of the community  By means of these interlacements I could verify the presence of certain dynamics in the local football contexts  where the actions to receive and to visit other teams imply intelligible duties and rules in a system of particular reciprocity  From the premise that heterogeneity exists of meanings and practices of the sport  I intent to discuss the dichotomic premises that fuel the debate involving  mostly  the uses of the concepts of sport and game  but also the ritualistic and the everyday aspects  keeping in mind that they are always interconnected
