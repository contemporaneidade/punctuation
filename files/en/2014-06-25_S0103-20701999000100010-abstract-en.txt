In this article I criticize the way many thesis on Social Sciences are written in Brazil  They rely too much on bibliography and they often apply mechanically some   la mode ideas to every sort of corpus  even if this latter has some richness the present theory is still unable to explain  Is this maybe due to an emptying of the desire to think  Shouldn t the University instill some spirit of risk in the students  instead of telling them to accomodate themselves  Some suggestions are made in order to change this regrettable statu quo
