Based on field research with the Aweti  a Tupi speaking group from the Upper Xingu  this article presents an analysis of the singularities of Xinguano magical aggression in an Amazonian context  by comparing the techniques  sociology and political effects of these practices  Contrary to the prevalent image of the anthropology of the region  the Xinguanos always identify the source of their greatest suffering in acts of people with whom they share intimate relations  frequently the victim s co villagers and always other Xinguanos  that is  members of what Ellen Basso has called the Xinguano moral community  a multiethnic group of allies defined  ideally  by the abdication of internal violence  The central hypothesis of this work is that Xinguano sorcery should be considered a part of mechanisms that produce enmity out of ordinary relations  meaning that the continuous effort to produce identity is never entirely complete
