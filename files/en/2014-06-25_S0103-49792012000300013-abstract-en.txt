Considering the theoretical methodological diversity of studies about youths inside and outside Brazil  this paper provides a general presentation of the theoretical contribution of the documentary method developed since Karl Mannheim for qualitative research on Social Sciences  Thus we may observe the analytical potential of the method for studying the collective orientations encouraged by young people in order to establish a life style centered on youth culture as a preponderant factor for generational configuration  In empirical terms  this article proposes an approach to the problem with regard to the marginalization of young people in communities located in the outskirts of the Federal District  taking Ceil ndia as an example  More precisely  the analytical cross section is the life style of the hip hop culture embraced by the youth of the Federal District  which is understood to be a mechanism for producing their collective orientations
