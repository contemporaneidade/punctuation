This article analyzes debates on justice and their implications for feminist critique  Our focus is on discussions of the need for an impartial point of view for producing criteria of justice  as they emerge from the works of John Rawls and Susan Okin  Okin s critique  as well as her adherence to Rawl s perspective  defends conciliating impartiality and feminist critique  in search of fairer gender relations  In Rawls  justice depends on the suspension of interests and affects linked to individuals  different positions within the social structure and their mutual possibilities to lay self interest aside  together with  lack of  knowledge of each one s own position  For Okin  recourse to impartiality does not exclude empathy  the consideration of difference and care for others  Expounding these positions  the article offers a critical discussion of the value of impartiality and concludes that adherence to liberal premises restricts the potential of a feminist critique of justice
