We live in a hyper visual world  where the image plays a key role in identification  ideological unveiling and socialization of meanings  But for a long time the image was neglected in the context of qualitative research methods  In this sense  it is essential that the human and social sciences recognize the potential of images for the purposes of social investigation  even though creating them might be characterized as an activity that requires expertise  Image analysis is not a simple task  easily accessible to any researcher  since overcoming the inherent level of interpretation  or the level of common sense  requires deepening the theoretical frameworks that help to read beyond what it tells at a first look  In this sense  this paper presents a practical exercise of a photograph analysis based on the documentary method  which has its origin in Karl Mannheim s Sociology of Knowledge  The adaptation of the documentary method for image analysis was developed by Ralf Bohnsack  who  to that end  also returned to the theory of Iconography by Ervin Panofsky and the contributions of authors such as Max Imdahl and Roland Barthes  With this article we aim to offer a counterpoint to the recurring criticism that claims lack of theoretical grounding  reflection  and methodological rigor in both the treatment and the analysis of data  At the same time  we intended to encourage the inclusion of other sources in addition to text interview and observation  such as photographs  images and movies  in the qualitative research
