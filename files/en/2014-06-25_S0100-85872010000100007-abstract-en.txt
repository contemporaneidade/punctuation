This paper discusses the particular aspects of the identity process among Charismatic Catholic youths via the analysis of the practices observed in prayer groups and congregations as well as literature and workshops prepared by layman leaders of the movement  The Shalom Community with its headquarters in Fortaleza  and branches throughout almost all Brazilian state capitols serves as the point of reference  This process is responsible for establishing new modes of living together with those others and has made explicit practices which raise strong issues regarding religious tolerance and which seem to place restrictions on the necessary inclusion of these youths in a pluralist society
