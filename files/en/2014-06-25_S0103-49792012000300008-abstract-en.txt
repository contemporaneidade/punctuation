The anthropology of neoliberalism has become polarized between a hegemonic economic model anchored by variants of market rule and an insurgent approach fueled by derivations of the Foucaultian notion of governmentality  Both conceptions obscure what is  neo  about neoliberalism  the reengineering and redeployment of the state as the agency that sets the rules and fabricates the subjectivities  social relations  and collective representations suited to realizing markets  I develop Bourdieu s concept of  bureaucratic field  to propose a via media between these two approaches that construes neoliberalism as an articulation of state  market  and citizenship that harnesses the first to impose the stamp of the second onto the third  This conception repatriates penality at the core of the production of a Centaur state that practices laissez faire at the top of the class structure and punitive paternalism at the bottom
