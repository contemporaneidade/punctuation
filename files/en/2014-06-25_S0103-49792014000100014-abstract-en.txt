This paper analyzes two proposals of structural reorganization of northeastern society  prepared at different moments in time  one under Celso Furtado s intellectual leadership and the other under Mangabeira Unger s leadership  It argues that both stem from the premise that the fight against the serious problems faced by the country s most unequal region requires bold institutional reconstruction  as well as the adoption of public policies that confront the structural constraints of the region  rather than just lessen them  It reinforces the idea that the project that gave origin to SUDENE  Superintendence for the Development of the Northeast  headed by Furtado  served as inspiration to the second latest venture  since the two initiatives were based on ideas that surpass a merely redistributivist perspective
