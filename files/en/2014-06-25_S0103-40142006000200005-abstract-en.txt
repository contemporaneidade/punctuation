ADMINISTRATIVE records from consular representations in Brazil and abroad are not adequate to estimate international migration balance  the difference between inmigration and emigration  for two main reasons  First  such data are not always available  Second  even if available  these data are not reliable sources of internatonal migration flows due to underestimation of illegal migration  Thus  it is not possible to use these records to unveil the magnitude and direction of Brazil s international migration balance  Indirect techniques allows estimating international migration balance from two consecutive censuses  These techniques involve comparing the population in the second census  the  observed population  and an  expected population  which is an estimation of the closed population in the second census  that is  the expected population in the second census assuming absence of international migration   emigration and inmigration   between the two censuses  The difference between the observed and the closed population is a proxy of the international migration balance  Even considering problems in these estmations  notably the variability in census coverage rates between 1980 and 1991  it can be inferred that Brazil had a negative migraton balance  or alternatively  a higher number of emigrants compared to inmigrants  of about 1 8 million people  The balance  still negative  felt to about 550 000 people between 1990 2000  This decline can be attributed almost entirely to the decline in Brazilian emigration  The 1991 and 2000 censuses reveal a very small increase in Brazilian international inmigration
