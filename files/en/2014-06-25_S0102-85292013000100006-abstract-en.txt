This paper analyses an approach of International Political Sociology  IPS  inspired by a relational and processual methodology  questioning the assumptions of International Relations concerning the boundaries of the international  the vision of politics at the core of political sciences  and the methodological nationalism concerning society  In order to avoid dualisms  IPS discusses the different episteme at work and analyses the socio genesis of the practices of actors in their different professional and cultural universes  looking specifically to their struggles for power and to the processes of politicisation and  in securitisation  IPS is therefore constructivist in the sense that its authors are reflexive and deconstruct essentialist claims to knowledge  IPS is also empiricist inasmuch as the authors a re sensitive to the practices of human beings and their relationships to objects  and start their theories from these sociological and historical relationships always embedded in specific locations and time  Of course empiricism does not mean positivism  and constructivism does not mean an idealistic perspective where norms  ideas and beliefs lead the world  The aim of this perspective is to decolonize the study of practices of the  transnational societies of individuals  from the so called great debates of the Anglo American visions  reproduced in their philosophies and approaches of social sciences
