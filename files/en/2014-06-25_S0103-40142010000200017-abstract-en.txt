Fairytales  orally passed down from parents to children  have become a precious cultural asset over time  conveying human experience and perhaps even representing an inaugural moment of  organizing experience  for children  a possibility offered by literature  Our proposal here is to carry out a comparative study of the tales Little Red Riding Hood by Perrault  Fita Verde no Cabelo  Green Ribbon in her Hair  by Guimar es Rosa and Chapeuzinho Amarelo  Little Yellow Riding Hood  by Chico Buarque  considering that both Brazilian authors have established an inevitable dialogue with the source text  which dates from the 17th century  Indeed  though all three narratives focus on the issue of child growth  the different views conveyed by each of them will be pointed out  1  the moralizing and pedagogical approach of Perrault s tale  the dangers of child disobedience  the issue of sexual initiation  2  the metaphysical bias of Guimar es Rosa s tale  confrontation with finitude and death  going from the psychological to the metaphysical plane  and 3  the focus on the symbolic efficiency of poetry of Chico Buarque s tale  victory over childhood fears through the power of words  All of this is done taking Goethe s statement in his Theory of colors into account   When the artist gives over to his feeling  it immediately gives rise to a colored object
