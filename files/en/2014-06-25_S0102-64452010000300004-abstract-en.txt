This paper seeks to analyze a film by Humberto Mauro  O descobrimento do Brasil  1937  with the counterpoint of the film by Nelson Pereira dos Santos  Como era gostoso meu franc s  1970  Both deal  in various forms and even opposing  an emblematic aspect of the narrative on nation building  the  discovery  of Brazil and the first contacts between colonizer and colonized  I try to understand how such works converse with other reference documents  and pictorial imagery to make their representations and discourses about what they consider  true  national identity
