This essay addresses the process of Brazil s passive revolution  an ongoing  revolution without revolution  that has dominated the movement of Brazilian society from the founding days of the nation state through contemporary times  where the predominant topic has become the universalization of citizenship  Against a backdrop of emerging democracy  institutionalized through Brazil s 1988 Constitution  the essay asks about the chances of seeing a reversal in the direction of the binomial characteristic of passive revolutions   conservation change   towards a movement that places more emphasis on change rather than on conservation  Such a reversal would call for an actor identified with the expression of the antithesis  an actor who must in particular be capable of dealing with the relations between political democracy expressed within an institutional arena  on the one hand  and the process of social democratization  on the other   as has been the case of today s Landless Workers Movement  Although within the social arena social movements have managed to trigger molecular ruptures in the forms of domination to which they have traditionally been exposed  if they are to turn this process of transformismo to their favor  they must move into the realm of the state  something that will inevitably require these actors to enter into alliances and to endeavor to gain recognition as general interpreters of their society
