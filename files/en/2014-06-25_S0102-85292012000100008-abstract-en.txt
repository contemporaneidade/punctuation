The main goal of this article is to understand why the World Bank has reached more bureaucratic autonomy than the International Monetary Fund regardless the fact that both have similar institutional structures  We believe that the reason for such difference is a more diverse expertise of the World Bank compared to the IMF  We claim that a more diverse bureaucracy increases the likelihood of coalition formation with NGOs  Such coalitions aim to support policies that are important for both the bureaucracy and the NGO s  Consequently  they increase the costs for both State intervention and State control over the organization  The higher costs of intervention and control allow bureaucrats to act more freely according to their interests  Hence  our hypothesis is the following  the more diverse the bureaucratic expertise  the more likely is the formation of coalitions between bureaucracy and NGOs  and the greater the costs for State control and intervention  Higher intervention and control costs  in turn  increase bureaucratic autonomy  We use mainly qualitative research methods with some descriptive statistics
