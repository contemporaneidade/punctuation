THERE WILL only be resistance to violent action when human awareness is awakened  That is why the author appeals to authentic religions  hoping they may create the conditions for world peace   not only through prayers  but above all by establishing a climate of world peace  So far  in this new phase of facing an increasingly agonizing problem  little has been required from the world of religions and still less from young people s initiatives  In brief  the author s proposal is for the University of S o Paulo to create the conditions to prepare young people for their future responsibility in favor of peace  This should begin as soon as  and persevere as much as possible  A world ethics would certainly be welcome at this time
