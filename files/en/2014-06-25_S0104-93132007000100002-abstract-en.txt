The starting point of this article is the thesis developed in 1991 by Isabelle Comb s and Thierry Saignes on the birth of Chiriguano ethnicity and identity  both mixed  in essence  The Chiriguano and the Chan  appear to maintain a somewhat paradoxical relationship with miscegenation  however  Although considered paradigmatic examples of Amerindian miscegenation  some contemporary views anticipate the dissolution of the ethnic group precisely because of its mixture with whites  At the same time  the Chiriguano themselves reject any idea of mixture  proclaiming themselves to be simply  Guarani  Based on a double case study of the Bolivian Isoso and the Argentinean Northwest  the article casts doubt on the idea of the complete absorption of the Chan  by the Chiriguano complex  it then analyzes the different types of miscegenation in existence and their relation to an asymmetrical schema that creates a scale of values between different ethnic groups  Finally  the authors suggest that the ideological ambivalence surrounding miscegenation is precisely due to the fact that it is a hybrid construct  the product of the fusion between Chan  and Guarani ideologies
