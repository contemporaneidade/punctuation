This article reflects on the political dimension of the aesthetics of RAP  The study focuses on both physical and social aspects of the processes of urban expansion and peripheralization in the city of S o Paulo  based on the analysis of excerpts of songs from the RAP group Racionais MCs  We seek to analyze the insertion of their poetry in confrontation between  center  and  periphery  as categories negotiated in the conflictive dynamics of social relations in the urban space  The article concludes noting the tensions established in the relations of RAP with  on the one hand  the institutional order of the State and  on the other hand  the dynamics of the  criminal world  and pointing out the social and the poetic features in which lie both the strength and the ambiguity of the political potential of its aesthetics
