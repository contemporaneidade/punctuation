This text is a balance of current studies on Social Economy  with three goals in mind  Firstly  it seeks to set out a profile of theoretical discussions  examining those authors who consider Social Economy a process of social transformation or those who emphasize the ephemeral character of economic units inside this sector  secondly  it analyses the Argentinean experience  one of the most important social phenomenon in the first years of the current decade  finally  based on some balances on the national level  it looks at the Brazilian experience  The final considerations underline the complexity of the Social economy phenomenon  criticizing dualistic analyses  which emphasize either its potentialities or its limits
