Through the biographical and literary narrative produced by a concentration camp survivor  the Italian Jew Primo Levi  describing the strategies of interaction and representation he adopted in order to go on living  this article engages in some reflections on Erving Goffmann s sociology  It seeks to apprehend processes of the production of subjectivity and individuality within a  total institution  through looking at the role of social spaces in the construction of particular interactions  such as those that took place within a concentration camp  as described in Levi s book  If this is a man  This analysis leads to a reflection on the micro and the macro in Goffman s sociology  as well as an inquiry into the existence of a theory of institutions within it  Thus  in looking at this dimension of Goffman s work  through the prism of Levi s description of his experience in a total institution  we seek both to access a diversified narrative on one particular social space and to raise some questions regarding Goffman s views  particularly with regard to the ways in which his sociology gives dynamism to particular interactions  history and social structures that go beyond the terrain of interaction  Thus it seems that an analysis of interactions that are immanent to particular places does not enter into contradiction with the perception and analysis of wider social processes  The concentration camp  for example  instituted and produced its own sociabilities  although understanding the latter also includes the need to understand the emergence of Nazism  the history of persecuted groups and the meaning of the Holocaust in its relationship to the  civilizing process  or a particular form of modern rationality
