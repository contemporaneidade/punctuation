The present paper is aimed at understanding the political appointments for high level governmental posts in our recent democratic experience  By examining the connections between politics and bureaucracy in the Brazilian presidential system  we focus specifically on the first Cardoso term  1995 1998  and within this  on the case of the Ministry of Finance  The choice of this ministry can be justified due to its high profile in the current hard times of monetary stabilization and fiscal constraints  and because it is deemed to be a mainly technical government department and  immune  to political interference
