The article discusses the effects of the recent process of flexibilization in industrial  automobile  production on labour relations  on workers and their unions  As an example  the authors examine the first Brazilian plant to be opened by the French manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citro n  installed in Porto Real  Rio de Janeiro  in 2001  They argue that the construction of a  shrunk  and restructured plant   a project designed to move beyond Fordist organization as an integral part of a global productive chain   reconfigures the relations with workers  and with the union  in the factory space by creating the demand for higher levels of schooling  a greater capacity to adapt to new technologies  and new forms of organizing production  However  these relations maintain authoritarian practices while preventing the reproduction of previous forms of worker resistance  The debate benefits from the research on the same company conducted by Michel Pialoux and St phane Beaud  who have analyzed its managerial transformations over the last few decades and the impact on the lifestyles of different generations of workers
