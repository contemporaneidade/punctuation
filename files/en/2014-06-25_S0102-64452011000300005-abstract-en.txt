In the last decades there has been a surprising conceptual shift between the role of three concepts   political representation  participation and accountability   in the internal criticism of democracy  This article sheds light on that shift by examining the reciprocal redefi nition of meaning between those concepts and the shape of a new conceptual network for democratic critique  Nowadays  internal critique of democracy has been developed from the stand point of representation theories  which used to be traditionally related to the defense of democracy  Participatory democracy models  once the main stand point for criticizing democracy  either lost influence or where integrated to more sophisticated deliberative democratic models  We argue that this state of affairs is due to a conceptual worthy dissociation between representative government and political representation  This dissociation works under democratic and pluralistic assumptions  thus  it is sensible to legitimacy challenges faced by extra parliamentary political representation  In this scenario  accountability appears as a normative concept useful for dealing with those challenges  We argue as well that the democratic critical leverage of the concept of participation relied on historical circumstances that are not longer in place  rendering standard defi nitions of participation inaccurate for the understanding of ongoing experiences of democratic innovation
