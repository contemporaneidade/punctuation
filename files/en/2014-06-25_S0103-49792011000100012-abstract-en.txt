This paper is about the trajectories of the residents of a housing estate on the outskirts of Sao Paulo made by a self managed task force  This task force occurred in the context of the democratic experience of the 80s  The hypothesis is that the forms of sociability and the trajectories of these residents  influenced by the discourse of autonomy and participation  are called into question  on the one hand  the possibility of invention  of the production of a house through an autonomous action and  on the other hand  the permeability of that experience to a certain sociability enclosed by the limits determined from outside and inside the its own set  To this end  we made a series of interviews and tried not to lose sight of the context that determines a reduced field of possibilities  This perspective enables one to collect not only the action of these movements  but also how the poorest of the city are organized to confront this social inequality produced in urban areas
