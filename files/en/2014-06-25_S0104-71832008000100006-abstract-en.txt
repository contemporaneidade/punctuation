The author offers a reflection based on the works presented at the exhibit Iconoclash  Beyond the Image Wars in Science  Religion and Art  at the Center for New Art and Media  in Karlsruhe in 2002  where the curators put together three fields   religion  science and contemporary art  in which images have been presented as  cultural weapons  through an ambiguous struggle that both produces and destroys images  icons and emblems  Iconoclash was the term chosen to define the theme of this exhibition and guide the author s reflection on hatred and fanaticism  in the diverse ambits of the cultural  social and political life  Moving towards an alternative type of  iconophilia  beyond the image wars  the author suggests the suspension of the iconoclast gesture  opting for a cascade of images in transformation  instead of focusing obsessively on images fixed and frozen out of their flow
