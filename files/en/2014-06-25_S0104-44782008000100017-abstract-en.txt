This text offers a critical analysis of the liberal concept of freedom as it has been elaborated by Isaiah Berlin  who has understood it basically in the negative  This understanding of freedom  in its numerous formulations  has remained hegemonic within contemporary debates on freedom  rights and their circumstances  Based on such considerations  we have tried to demonstrate that when freedom is conceived of in the negative  it is unable to promote individual autonomy   exactly that which it supposedly exists in order to protect   without resorting to a project of distributive justice that takes elements of the socialist inspired critique of liberalism into account
