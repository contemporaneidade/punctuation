This paper reveals the central position that the article  Cosmologies of Capitalism  occupies in the work of Marshall Sahlins  At the same time  it suggests criticisms of some of Sahlin s propositions  but does so by assuming a posture internal to the author s work  This perspective stresses the fact the  trans Pacific sector of the world system  is  indeed  composed of a system of exchanges  but that these exchanges serve to do much more than to inter connect functionally different societies  The present paper radicalises this argument and tries to show how an anthropology of exchange can be the basis for the study of the history of any Indigenous society and of its contacts with capitalist realities
