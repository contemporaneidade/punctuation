From 1900 to 1930 Argentina was changed under the impact of massive European immigration provoking a remaking of the national identity  However  the project of a nation masks its heterogenity and denies a space both to the communities that become submerged through it and to the alternative imaginaries that it displays  The article is an illustration of these particular processes through the lens of the impact of gaucho imagery and dress in tango  In this context we will see that the gaucho dress and folk traditions were key components of a nationalist revival  The article tries to show that the connection between gaucho imagery and dress  in theory belonging to the past  embraces also tango  the modern dance and music created in Argentina in the 1880s and 1890s and exported to the world at the beginning of the twentieth century  The paper also examines the confluence of nationalism in Argentina with European ideas of exoticism and primitivism in defining an arena in which tango could be referred as gaucho music and dance
