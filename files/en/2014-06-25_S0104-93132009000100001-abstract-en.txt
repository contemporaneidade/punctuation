This article concerns the existence of a segregated order and the functioning of the category of  aborigine  in South western Australia during the 20th century  Looking beyond the  official  definitions of the aboriginal population  we will analyse the practical modalities of identification  particularly through an analysis of the census and the statistical classifications of the Aborigines  We will show that  in the absence of official documents specifically geared towards the aborigines  attesting to their register in a central file  the techniques concerning their identification resembled pre industrial forms of recognizing people  based on familiarity and on face to face relations  A consequence of this situation is that those people who were locally known to be aborigines  or who had physical traits that were readily identified as being aboriginal  found themselves caught in a coercitive system from which it was difficult to escape  whereas others were able to pass through the identificatory mesh without  in so doing  placing in check a markedly dichotomous system of racial relations
