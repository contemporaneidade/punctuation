This article examines delays in the penal justice system  Time is the measure of justice  The longer a case takes  the less chance there is to correct technical failures in the administrative procedures or locate witnesses  other victims or possible aggressors  If too short  there is a risk of contravening rights enshrined in the Brazilian Constitution and penal laws  thereby producing injustice rather than justice  For common citizens  time is the place of collective memory  When they can make links between the crime committed and the application of penal sanctions  they feel that justice has been applied  conferring credibility to the institutions responsible for retributive justice  This article explores these claims through an empirical study of the penal investigations conducted to establish criminal responsibility for lynchings perpetrated in the state of S o Paulo from 1980 to 1989
