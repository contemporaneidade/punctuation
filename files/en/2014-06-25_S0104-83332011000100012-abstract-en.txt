This article examines the representations of pregnancy in the magazine Revista da Gestante  particularly the notion that this is a process that may be to a large extent controlled by pregnant women  In this magazine  articles present a prescriptive discourse  with  tips  to a  happy and calm  pregnancy  They focus on the idea that pregnancy has an emotional nature  especially due to the frequent sentiments of fear and anxiety  By analyzing these emotions  I argue that pregnant women are seen as autonomous agents who are relatively isolated from their social circle  except for their relations with medical specialists  Self control during pregnancy  thus  becomes an issue  reinforcing a wider concern with emotional control common in modern western societies
