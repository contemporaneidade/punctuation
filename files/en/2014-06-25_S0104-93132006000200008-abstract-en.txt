Analysis of a particular conversation held in Fiji suggests that we know what is true primarily by the evidence of our own and others  eyes  Even so  in this Fijian case  truth is not necessarily a priori  it is not always given in the nature of things  in certain cases   witchcraft  for example   what is true remains to be found out  Ditto for whether or not a person s words or acts are mana  that is to say  materially effective  The Fijian idea is that speech or  more generally the word  vosa  as it is spoken or written  may be mana  effective  and thus what is true  dina  may be an outcome rather than already given  The objective of the paper is not to translate Fijian terms  but to render them analytical  The argument here is that because the environing world provides for all the meanings that humans can make  our own understandings  as anthropologists and human beings  are just as amenable to historical analysis as the next person s  it follows that the explanatory power of our ethnographies must be made to reside in rendering our informants  categories analytical  Finally  the paper makes use of the Fijian material to argue that ideas about what language is good for  its moral force  are crucial to understanding what is said and suggests the analytical utility of laying bare the ontogeny of the moral force of language in any given case
