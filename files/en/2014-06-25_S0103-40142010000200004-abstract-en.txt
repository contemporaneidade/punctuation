While the topic of Spanish intellectual Miguel de Unamuno s relationship with Portugal has received a good deal of scholarly attention  this has focused on affirming Unamuno s longstanding interest in Portuguese literature and history  and on confirming the existence of relationships of influence between Unamuno and prominent Portuguese writers  This paper  instead  will consider how Unamuno fits Portugal into his broader vision of Iberia as a dialectical unity  and will demonstrate how Unamuno s use of a corporeal vocabulary  of carne y hueso  contributes to the fleshing out of his vision of a dialectical Iberia  in which Portugal plays an integral role
