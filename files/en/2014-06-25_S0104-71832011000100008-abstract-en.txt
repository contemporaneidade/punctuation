There is a growing number of companies in different regions of the world  especially in North America  offering genetic ancestry tests based on DNA  This phenomenon has attracted attention in the social sciences  particularly anthropology  In this paper  we present a case study that explores  based on a comparative anthropological perspective  the profiles of three companies located in different countries that commercialize genetic ancestry tests  African Ancestry  in the United States  Oxford Ancestors  in England  and Laborat rio GENE  in Brazil  Based on an analysis of their respective websites and materials released in the media  the objective is to use the first two as a counterpoint to the third in order to evaluate the similarities and differences in how they characterize the revelatory potential of their respective tests  We also explore the manner in which subjects such as ethnic racial affiliation appear in the merchandising of their products and in their public postures  More broadly  it is emphasized that specific sociopolitical contexts influence the manners in which the genetic ancestry tests are presented and justified for their respective public consumers  In the specific case of the Brazilian company  it is argued that consideration of the broad historical and anthropological panorama of  race  and racial relations  as well as the current debates on the subject  helps us understand how ancestry tests are justified and presented to the public
