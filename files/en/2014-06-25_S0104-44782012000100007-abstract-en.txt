The present paper seeks an understanding of the ideology of the Republican Party of the United States of America with respect to the State  through its ideas and position regarding the way the State is financed  the taxation of United States citizens  For this purpose  we have looked at the history of the Republican Party and made a case study of the tax cuts implemented by President George Bush during his first mandate  2001 2004  asking what they were  who they benefitted and what kind of impact they had on the financing of United States state machinery  We analyze the ideological reasons for these cuts and how they reflect the current Republican position on the State  contextualizing and contrasting this position with those that were adopted and defended by the Party at the time of its founding and over the course of its history  We discover than the history of the Republican Party can be divided into two ideological phases  the first one  which runs from its founding in 1854 through the mid 1920s in which the State is seen as inducing economic development and maintaining national unity and the second  which brings us up to the present  in which the State gradually cedes its role in inciting the economy to one in which individual freedom should prevail and in which the State is increasingly seen as an obstacle which should be eliminated
