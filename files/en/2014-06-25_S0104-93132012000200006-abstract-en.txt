This paper introduces the Brazilian public to the recent debate on secularism  drawing upon two collections   Varieties of secularism in a secular age  2010  and Rethinking secularism  2011 The various authors contributing to these works intend to pursue the critique Charles Taylor makes in A Secular Age  2007  which questions the thesis of that religion can withdraw from social spheres without causing profound changes  i e  a thesis which ignores the relational character that exists between religion and these spheres  The main argument mobilized is  accordingly  the need to reevaluate the secular   religious dichotomy  through a better understanding of the mutual constitution of both poles  as well as the effect of this dichotomy in countries outside of the  North Atlantic world  and the Judeo Christian tradition   Secularization   secularism  and  secular  are thus differentiated as three related  but not homogeneous  phenomena  The underlying proposal  which calls for research into the  formation of the secular  seeks to study secular positivity  rather than the simple absence of religion
