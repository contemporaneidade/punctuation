This paper discusses the relationship that exists between Brazilian republicans and the idea of the abolition of slavery  The republicans did not form a monolithic bloc  figures such as Lu s Gama and Silva Jardim  for example  did not dissociate the struggle for the Republic from the struggle for Abolition  thus standin in contrast to republican landowners who  without struggling directly against Abolition  made no efforts on its behalf  The most  radical  of republicans  those who sought to associate both struggles  would eventually have to break with the official Republican movement   cases in point  Patroc nio and Gama   or collude with Republican slave and landowners   as was the case of Silva Jardim  Cissions within the more radical field of the Republican movement contributed to strengthening the more  moderate  or even the  conservative  Republican groups that came to dominate Brazilian republicanism  Our central hypothesis is that the treatment given to the issue of abolition was fundamental in determining the shape that the Republic took on in Brazil
