Research on masculinity is now worldwide  offering us rich bases for understanding masculinities in global arenas  The issue of globalization has increasingly come into focus in gender studies  and research on masculinity specifically  This paper shows the usefulness of a life history approach to understanding gender  based ultimately on psychoanalysis though modified for use in social scientific field work  A case study from the Australian part of a multi country study of corporate masculinities is presented  It concerns a middle aged manager in the construction industry  who reveals a conservative form of hegemonic masculinity  This was fostered in his family of origin  in his education and in the heavily masculinized construction industry  His managerial labour process is a kind of bricolage of negotiations and relationships that are more local and concrete than abstract and globalized  This pattern of masculinity is articulated with the global economy but does not exactly reproduce the hegemonic masculinity of transnational corporations  which are by contrast marked by high levels of education and technological involvement  Two sites of contradiction in this manager s life  i e  his embodiment and his family relations  are identified  which may cause problems for the smooth management of his life  There is also in the interview a curious moment of utopia that calls into question his gender project
