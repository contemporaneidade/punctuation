Brazil is a country that ages increasingly  In 2011  the elderly population marks 20 5 million  equivalent to 10 8  of the entire population  Projections suggest that  in 2020  the elderly Brazilian population will be 30 9 million  representing 14  of the whole population  This fast growing of the elderly population requires social services and demands appropriate political answers from both  the state and society  Among the many challenges to be faced is the one of the care services  The public policies for the elderly consider the family  the state and the society equally responsible for the care  In practical terms  this matter has been seen as a private and not a public issue  materializing in the figure of the woman  the job of looking after the elderly  The objective of this paper is to show how inadequate this model that elects women as the only responsible for the care is and also explores the possibilities of a new one that allows an aging processguided by civic values  in which the family  the state and other actors of society play their roles
