In  The Road to Serfdom  F  A  Hayek argues that the economic planning defended in some socialist doctrines leads to the same kind of serfdom present in totalitarian states  Based on this  he concludes that the only way to guarantee freedom is to implement economic liberalism  Hayek identifies some of the characteristics found in totalitarian systems  pointing out that socialist states have those very same characteristics  This paper intends to show that the characteristics described by Hayek as typical of the totalitarian systems are very present in the modern day United States  Hence  economic liberalism leads to the same serfdom found in totalitarian systems  Polanyi has shown us that serfdom is not a result of power centralization or economic planning  but of the very act of submitting people s day to day life to impersonal systems  We can conclude that there are several possible roads to serfdom  three of which the human race has already trailed  the totalitarian  the communist and the liberalist
