In this paper  I analyze links between the notions of production  intellectual property and culture  Starting at the articulations among inventor and invention  I show some problems about the category of intellectual property  highlighting dualities of the Western thought  I emphasize three tensions for analyzing intellectual property issues in anthropology  especially between material culture and intangible goods  continuities and ruptures on intellectual and cultural property  and the dissolution of multiplicity in the  public vs  private  dichotomy  An ethnographic case study is presented  carried out within organic smallholders from the West of Santa Catarina  Brazil  In this case  I discuss their collective experiences associated to a set of problems they face while dealing with  modern  agriculture  The paper explores the grammar which operates in their lives and has connections to the intellectual property regimes  The intention is to show that those are some emblems in the way capitalism renew and  de constitute experience
