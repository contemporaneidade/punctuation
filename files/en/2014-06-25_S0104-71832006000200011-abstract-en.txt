This article is a rereading of the Evans Pritchard classic  Witchcraft  Oracles and Magic among the Azande  that attempts to provide new understandings of the difference between  us  and  them  Its starting point is the realization that Evans Pritchard s book is at once an example of asymmetric anthropology and a source of data and analyses that permit new explorations  Two connections exemplify these possibilities  one makes use of accounts of the death of Tancredo Neves  while the other discusses the contradictions of modernity  The analysis then proceeds by seeking to outline a kind of ontography of the Azande  which exposes the limitations of interpretations of its witchcraft that are restricted to sociological or linguistic dimensions  The inclusion of an Azande hunting net in a New York art exhibition  that inspires the final comments  epitomizes proposals that aim at attaining an understanding of differences by engendering some connections
