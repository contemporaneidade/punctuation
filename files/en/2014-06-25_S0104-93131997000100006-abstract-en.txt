This essay s objective is to identify the productivity of several of Pierre Bourdieu s formulations regarding art and aesthetics in allowing for a properly anthropological reflection on this theme  situating it in the realm of contemporary discussions exploring its comparative dimension  Based on a parallel with the theory of magic proposed by Marcel Mauss  the essay is constructed along three lines  identifying the perspective underlying Bourdieu s theoretical effort  mapping out some of its main developments  and investigating its theoretical breadth  This approach permits one to demonstrate the methodological statute of  distinction  in its connection to Bourdieu s sociological relativism  as well as to perform a critical assessment of the contemporary debate over the conditions allowing for an anthropology of art and or aesthetics in terms of a counterpoint between particularism and universalism
