During the 1990 s  the presence of Brazilian Art became more and more visible in the international art scene  Curators and other international agents adopted a kind of  politically correct  discourse according to which borders between center and periphery   that always organized the international artistic field   would disappear  thus allowing peripheral art to enter the most prestigious institutions of central countries  Nevertheless  most of the exhibitions  including Brazilian art  do not correspond to a democratization of the international artistic field and do not help to promote Brazilian art internationally  In fact  they reflect the perverse consequences of globalization  serving to raise the prestige and the economic power of a few institutions and individuals and to reduce Brazilian culture to stereotypes  In order to illustrate this idea we will analyze the following exhibitions in this paper  Brazil Body and Soul  Guggenheim Museum  New York  H lio Oiticica Quasi Cinemas  New Museum  New York  Un art populaire  Cartier Foundation Paris  Tunga and Mira Schendel  Galerie National du Jeu de Paume  Paris
