This paper shows how the police took diverse organizational forms in national contexts  instead of producing in its agents everywhere a very similar world view  Centrally or locally organized  the men women in charge express themselves in the same terms  We try to explain this trend by pointing to the daily experience of policing which are shared by all police forces  and where any explanation of police thinking must be sought  We present as example the daily activities of Rio de Janeiro s police in early twentieth century  showing their relation with the elites and how they create at the same time the boundaries of police authority and the perception of the existence of certain groups against whom extra legal means of pressure can be exerted
