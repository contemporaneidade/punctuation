The participants in this round table have in common the consideration of the role of Political Philosophy in the theoretical tradition named Political Science  Refusing the position that dissociates Political Philosophy of the empirically oriented dimension of the discipline  the arguments here presented outline the importance of Political Philosophy as a promoter of life forms  The agenda of the researchers devoted to the good conduction of empirical investigation has been  and still is  greatly defined by previous initiatives of social and political invention and by ontological  epistemological and rhetorical decisions  In this sense  the distinction between science and philosophy is not only obscurantist and epistemologically optimistic  but also a symptom of a strong ignorance concerning political knowledge history
