The article offers a critical appraisal of the concept of multiple modernities that has been gaining ground in sociology during the past decade  It rejects this concept as both conceptually flawed and empirically unfounded  and it proposes an alternative concept  that of varieties of modernity  which is believed to be better able to address the former s substantive concerns  while at the same time permitting us to speak of modernity in the singular  The main source of inspiration for such an alternative concept is the varieties of capitalism paradigm guiding the new political economy literature  and one of its advantages over the multiple modernities paradigm is its focus on institutions  rather than vague  barely explicated notions of culture and cultural difference  However  a varieties of modernity approach that followed its lead would have to be much broader and more comprehensive  and would therefore be more difficult to develop and to apply  than the varieties of capitalism paradigm  But even if it ultimately proved infeasible  the very consideration of its methodological prerequisites would still promise to yield valuable insights for students of modernity
