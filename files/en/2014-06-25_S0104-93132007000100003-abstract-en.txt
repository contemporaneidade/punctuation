Taking the Families Anonymous association as its empirical object  this essay analyzes three distinct aspects inter related by the therapeutic approach adopted by these groups  a  the use of oral narrative and the exchange of shared experiences as a form of acquiring new meanings and new forms of responding to the problem that first led the family members to contact the association  b  the conflict between discourse and practice  focusing above all on the dichotomy between  I  member of Families Anonymous  and  I  father mother of a drug addict  and c  the recourse to anonymity as an element that allows control of the stigma and personal information that each member gives about him or herself
