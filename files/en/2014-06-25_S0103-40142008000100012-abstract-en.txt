In this work I show that nationalism  together with liberalism  socialism  efficientism and the environmentalism  is one of the ideologies of the modern societies  In the first section  I define nation as the form of society politically organized that is born with the Capitalist Revolution and leads to the formation of the nation state  and nationalism as the corresponding ideology  its objective is the autonomy and the national economic development  In the second section  I distinguish the nationalism of the central countries from that one of the peripheral countries  while in the first the nationalism is implicit  in the peripherals is explicit or then turn to the cosmopolitism  In the third section I argument that the imperialism  even being inevitable between strong and week countries  will change its characteristics when this relation of forces is modified as a consequence of the nationalism of the dominated ones  Still in this section  I make one brief reference to Brazil  Finally  I come back to the ideologies of the capitalism to show that  differently from the others  the nationalism is a particularist ideology  which increases the resistance to it and facilitates the task of domination of the central countries  Yet  the nationalism does not disappear because it is an organizer principle of the capitalist society
