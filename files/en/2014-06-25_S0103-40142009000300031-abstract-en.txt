In this article  I analyze the rhetoric deployed in Casa grande   senzala  without resorting to the dualistic framework in which the work has been studied  I will demonstrate how parts of this essay  very different in their constitutive principles  e g  nostalgic excerpts  anthropological analysis  are articulated in order to propose a memory pact with the reader  In this pact  the experiences of rural Brazil are remembered lyrically  whereas rural Brazilian racial stereotypes are refuted scientifically  On the one hand  there is an attempt to rescue the affective dimension of patriarchal private life  while on the other hand  the book tries to discard many racial prejudices produced by that same world  Freyre s work sets forth a memory decantation  a subtle dialectics between remembering and forgetting  My argument thereby suggests that memory in Casa Grande   Senzala must be taken into account as something much more complex than mere nostalgic lamentation  I finally argue that the importance of understanding of this memory pact is twofold  it helps both to identify the constitutive features of racial democracy discourse and to deconstruct that same discourse
