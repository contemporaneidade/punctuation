In this paper  our main goal is to offer some relevant clues as to the framing of images in the cultural logic of post modernism  At the same time  we will give space to a brief description of the relation between post modernism and flexible accumulation  the generative substratum from which our subject derives  Along with this  we conceptualize theses on imagetic transmutation  the primacy of the image and the effect of dematerialization induced by the image in the perception of social relations  In this way  a conceptual chain is constituted with the purpose of connecting only apparently fragmented phenomena and social processes such as the productive basis of contemporary capitalism  its cultural reality and the place of the image in all that wide framing
