The article seeks to return to the discussion about the class character of the capitalist State  placing in dialogue three contributions that  in general  are not approximate  Bourdieu s understanding of the functioning of the political field  the idea of the material institutionalty of the State in the last Poulantzas and Offe s initial discussion on the selectivity of the institutions  The problem is to understand how universal access to the political public sphere  with the formal granting of equal rights to all  coexists with the permanence of class domination  although this concept is understood differently by the three authors  Conversely  the problem can be formulated as the need to demonstrate the continuing domination in situations in which the dominated classes seem to get wins and even equip the state in their favor
