The article is a critical analysis of rational choice explanations in social science  It is argued that there are a number of restrictions to this work  First  many authors in this tradition develop post hoc theories  they adjust their theoretical framework to available empirical evidence  The theories are thus immunised against empirical refutation  Second  the so called internalist approaches fail to distinguish between acting as though one is rational on the one hand  and acting because one is rational on the other  Third  the so called externalist perspectives fail to differ significantly from other theories  Fourth  rational choice theories mistakenly assume that rationality is free from cultural influence
