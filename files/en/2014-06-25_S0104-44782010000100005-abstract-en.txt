This article analyzes Brazil s foreign policy for Africa during the post Cold War period  As a permanent theme within the Brazilian diplomatic agenda for decades  Brazil Africa relations have taken on a salient role within Lula administration foreign policy  We attempt to understand the meanings and possibilities that it opens up for Brazil throughout the African continent  We do this by giving emphasis to the political and commercial dynamics between this country and its African partners  and we employ the following analytical variables  the diplomatic actions and the commercial flows that Brazil has established with African countries of the sub Sahara region  As our main argument  we maintain that the end of the Cold War brought substantial change within the Brazilian diplomatic agenda  directly affecting Brazil s relationship with its African partners  Thus  we argue that Brazil Africa relations have been characterized by intensely variable movement  with accentuated decline between the decades of the 1980s and 1990s and recovery and possible intensification during the Lula administration  Our work can be divided into four parts  In the first  we present a general picture of Brazil Africa relations during the period that precedes the 1980s  This is followed by a focus on the restrictive impact of international economic crises on African and Brazilian realities  seeking to identify their repercussion on Brazilian foreign policy with regard to Africa  The third part looks at possible opening up toward Brazil on the African continent  placing emphasis on the directives and proposals for foreign policy developed by the Lula government  The last section attempts to provide a synthesis of the arguments that have been developed
