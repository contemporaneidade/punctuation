Although narratives can be conceived both as a mode of  ordering  meaning and as symbolic manifestations of ideological forms  the poetic dimension of narrativity also involves the production of meanings and a proliferation of signs mediated by the act of  narrating the world  Adopting this theoretical premise  the essay seeks to explore the many stories of the so called spirits of the  povo da rua   street people  emphasizing the performative dimension of narrative  Recounted by  clients   practitioners  and the spirits themselves  such narratives are not only symbolic or representative  but also constitutive of the  supernatural power  attributed to the spirits  More than narrate a reality external to the stories  the narratives themselves become an inextricable part of the reality they narrate  By shifting the focus away from the framed space and time of ritual  the ethnographic narrative also seeks to evoke the very sociality of this narrating of the world
