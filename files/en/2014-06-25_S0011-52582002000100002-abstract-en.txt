This article analyzes the issue of party unity  investigating the factors that favor or discourage party breaks  Three independent variables are proposed  forming a model that seeks to evaluate the possibilities for splitting or maintaining party organization  The variables are the intra partisan institutional arrangement  internal ideological dissent  and the electoral costs of a split  The model is applied to the case of the Workers  Party  PT  seeking to evaluate which factors are the strongest in this party  those leading to a split or those favoring maintenance of unity in the party s organization  The study draws on various data sources  including party documents and bylaws  theses proposed by party factions  and election results  covering four national events in the 1990s  The study contends that intra partisan institutional arrangements and the electoral costs of a split have strongly discouraged any break in the PT as a political party  and that if all else remains constant  these factors will continue to produce the same effects in the foreseeable future
