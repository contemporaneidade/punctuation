The present article discusses the racial concepts of Arthur de Gobineau based on his most famous work  Essai sur l inegalit  des races humaines  Instead of associating these with the racialist debate of the last decades of the XIX the century  I relate them to a polemical text characteristic of the late XVII and early XVIII century  The Quarrel of the Two Races  In this sense  my main objective is to show that  in the first place  the Gobineau s work owes significant debts to the concept of the  bloodline  an idea which gradually became anachronistic after the French Revolution  In addition  I argue that  rather than being a study of supposedly  biological  races  Gobineau s  Essay  should be regarded as a refusal of the new egalitarian order of modern times
