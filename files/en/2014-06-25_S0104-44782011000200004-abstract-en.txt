This article examines the concept of democracy that is derived from the  neo Roman  formula of freedom as absence of domination  For those authors linked to the neo Roman tradition  the fulfillment of the republican principle of the people as the  guardian of freedom  depends upon the constitution of a model of contestatory democracy presented as surpassing the models of electoral and participatory democracy   both of which are considered to be tributaries of a positive conception of freedom  After an initial focus on the concept of contestatory democracy  this article goes on to analyze the major criticisms that have been made of this concept  Two objections are given salience  first  that the rationalism of the contestatory model leads to the de politization of democratic deliberation and second  that excessive neo Roman zeal against populism and the  tirany of the majority  reproduces the  elitist  characteristics of the classic Republican tradition  We conclude with a brief evaluation of the pertinence of these criticisms
