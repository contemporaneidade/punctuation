The essay tries to clarify how impunity has become a recurrent theme in the Brazilian debate over human rights  Absence of law enforcement has proven to be troublesome within a democratic society for two reasons  First  impunity is contrary to the principle of equal treatment under the law  Second  it may encourage the free rider  hindering social cooperation  The author argues that impunity may be associated with unfair and hierarquical social relations  where some are considered to be more deserving of protection than others  Therefore  it is necessary to explain which concept of human dignity is more suitable to be used in defense of human rights  The chosen concept is a Kantian one  placing a special value on the idea of liberty and personal autonomy  For this reason  the recognition of rights may be the basis for the defense of fundamental human rights  even if they have not been sufficiently recognized by the Brazilian debate
