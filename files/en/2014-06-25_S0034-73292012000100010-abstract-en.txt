This paper discusses the current challenges of the multilateral trade system  which are reflected in the WTO Doha Round deadlock  The main patterns of trade have changed due to the rise of global value chains and the globalization of the world economy  characterized by an increasing dispersion and fragmentation of industrial production  The article discusses the way these changes are challenging traditional assumptions of the multilateral trade system and the WTO Doha Round negotiations  Taking Brazil as an example  the paper argues that the mismatch between the negotiating agenda and the new world trade realities dwells in the very WTO member countries  which  at a great extent  have not yet aligned its trade policies to the new dynamics of the international trade  Finally  we argue that during the last ten years Brazil s trade policy has not properly considered the important changes in the international trade patterns brought about by global value chains and economic globalization
