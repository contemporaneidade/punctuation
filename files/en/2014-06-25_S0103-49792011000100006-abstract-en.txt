Through ethnographic analysis of the application of technology to measure blood pressure in medical consultations in a public medical center in Salvador  I am proposing to think of the articulation of a process of objectification of the body with the universe of experience  both by doctors and by patients  I will look carefully at the way the actors involved apply knowledge in the clinical encounter stemmed from the daily life and scope of Biomedicine  signaling how the control of hypertension is produced by and in turn produces  bodies experiencing the world through differentiating matrices such as class   gender or race  These bodies and these matrices of significance can not be separated in their real  material  symbolic and figurative sense
