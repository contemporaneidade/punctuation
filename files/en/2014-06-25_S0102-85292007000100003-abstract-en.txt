Since the creation of the Arab State System in the wake of the decolonization process  the rhetoric of arab nationalism has been the background over which the political relations have been developed among the arab states  However  these relations are far from achieving unity  and can be characterized more by the desintegration  The literature on political integration in the Arab World points several factors related to the apparently contraditory idea represented by the unifying arab nationalism speech and the abscence of integration in the region  These factors were analysed in this research in different periods selected to be studied  1954 1973  1973 1990  and 1990 2004  As theoretical reference  it was used the structural realism proposed by the English School of International Relations  In the attempt to answer the question that guided this research   what does condition the Arab World to live in a permanent fragmentation despite all the unifying arabist speech    it was sought to identify which of theses factors pointed by the literature about integration in the Arab World had a greater role for the non integrative arab phenomenon  It was revealed that only the lack of regional economic complementarity did not have a significant role for the absence of intra arab political integration between the years 1954 and 2004
