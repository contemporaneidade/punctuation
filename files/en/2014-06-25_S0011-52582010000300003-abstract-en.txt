The study explores the relationship between federalism and territorial inequality  taking Brazil as the object of analysis  The conclusion is that there is a trade off between territorial inequality reduction and the full autonomy of local governments  The central government s redistributive role seems to be a condition for reducing revenue inequality between jurisdictions  and so reducing inequality in citizens  access to public services requires the central government to perform redistributive and regulatory role  On the other hand  local autonomy pushes toward inequality  Hence  federal regulation and local autonomy are combined in a given polity  the result tends to be bound inequality
