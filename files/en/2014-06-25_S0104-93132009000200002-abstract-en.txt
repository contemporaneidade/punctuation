This essay is presented as a Benjaminian work site  The juxtaposition of apparently distant figures in brusque and surprising relations may well cause puzzlement  But the affinities are revealing  In the whirlpools of Michael Taussig s studies  I search for a theoretical composition in counterpoint  on one side  Victor Turner and Clifford Geertz  whose writings possibly lead us to think of a kind of paradigm of the dramatic theatre in anthropology  and  on the other  two figures on the margins of anthropology and the dramatic theatre   Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht  The essay s gravitational force is located on these margins  especially the fragmented work of Benjamin  In short  this is an essay towards a Benjaminian anthropology  organized around three allegories   1  magic mirror   2  shattering  and  3  flashes of light  In some ways  the journey suggests the form of an unusual rite of passage  the passage towards a passing condition
