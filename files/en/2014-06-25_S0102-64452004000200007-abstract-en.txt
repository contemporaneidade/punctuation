The starting point of the present article is Trotsky s biography by Pierre Brou  but it intends to be more than a mere review of the book  Following Trotsky s life story  it insists specially on the most democratic moments of his political life  Our Political Tasks  1904  and on the most authoritarian ones  the rejection of all political alliances in October 1917  the militarisation of labor etc  After that  the text analyses closely two problems related to Trotsky s fate  the problem of the tension between the internal democracy within the party and the external dictatorship  and  on a more general level  the problem of the nature of the political system under Lenin  and afterwards  under Stalin  Finally  it discusses the question of the relation between Marxism  Leninism and Stalinism
