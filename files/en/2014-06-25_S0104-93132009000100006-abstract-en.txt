Examining the experience of the Toba Qom of the Argentinean Chaco in the conquest of citizenship  land and the Gospel  we will analyze the multiple ways of being Qom  making it evident that  although there is an ample repertoire of possible ways of being Toba  this repertoire is not infinite  We stress that  from a subjectivity in becoming  the relationships of the Qom with the whites is  in principle  fundamental in the constitution of the self  and we highlight that  internal  differences are inherent in the historical process of constituting the Toba  We will analyze the multiple perspectives of relations with the whites that emerge in connection to the appearance of a neighbourhood in the urban fringe during the 1960 s  focusing on the Qom notions of agency without limiting ourselves either to the geographical frontiers of the neighbourhood or to the historical frontiers of the relationship between the Qom and the Nation State  The relationship of the Qom with the whites can be read as the history of the separation of similar beings  We propose to demonstrate that  in the counter current of this separation  through the Gospel  land and citizenship  and in seeking the conquest of equality  the Qom have  once again  sought to transform themselves into the affines of former foes
