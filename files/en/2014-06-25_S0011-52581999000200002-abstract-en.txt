Based on observation of the mass media s political impact  this article analyzes the 1998 election campaign coverage by the main Brazilian TV news program  Jornal Nacional  broadcast by the Globo Network  A total of 72 different editions of the program were analyzed  identifying the weight allotted to various issues and the way they were framed within the news budget  Globo s coverage prioritized the fait divers  while significant issues from the public agenda such as Brazil s increasing unemployment  the drought in the Northeast  and even the election race itself were virtually ignored  Meanwhile  Globo treated the worsening economic situation essentially as the Administration itself did  The conclusion was that  based on the news budget and the focus given to stories  the news program objectively favored President Fernando Henrique Cardoso s candidacy for reelection  The bias identified in these data calls attention once again to the urgent need to review the media s role in promoting political debate in Brazil
