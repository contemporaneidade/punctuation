MUCH HAS changed in Brazil since the studies of Roger Bastide in the 1940s  including the religious milieu of the Afro Brazilian religions  Old trends were confirmed  new directions imposed themselves  Newfangled religions confront the more established ones  old religions take on new forms and convey renewed contents to face increasingly strenuous competition in the religious marketplace  I will deal here with a demographically small religious faction that is nevertheless important in Brazilian culture because of the visibility of its followers  the Afro Brazilian religions  I will examine the various census figures in an attempt to assess the breadth of Afro Brazilian religions and will examine some traits of their followers   such as race and educational level  Then  without losing sight of the constitutional and organizational peculiarities of the cults and the terreiros  ritual grounds of the Candomble religion  I will attempt an explanation for the changes these religions are presently undergoing
