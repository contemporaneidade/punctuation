This essay synthesizes the results of the large number of studies of late 20th century democratization published during the last 20 years  Strong evidence supports the claims that democracy is more likely in more developed countries and that regime transitions of all kinds are more likely during economic downturns  Very few of the other arguments advanced in the transitions literature  however  appear to be generally true  This study proposes a theoretical model  rooted in characteristics of different types of authoritarian regimes  to explain many of the differences in democratization experience across cases in different regions  Evidence drawn from a data set that includes 163 authoritarian regimes offers preliminary support for the model proposed
