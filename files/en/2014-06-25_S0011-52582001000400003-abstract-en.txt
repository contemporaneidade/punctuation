Is the western liberal model of democracy adequate to analyze the new political regimes of the Third Wave of Democracy  After reviewing the recent literatures on democratization and economic reform  I refer to their signifying concepts  namely  governability  governance and democracy  as well as to their implicit normative biases  I give especial attention to the concept of democracy as used by those literatures  based on the so called procedural minimum  Schumpeter Dahl  Considered too minimum by leading authors  this definition has been expanded to include  precising  attributes  Rather than augmenting even further Dahl s list  I here propose to include in the regime change investigation the characteristics of the decision making process  as an analytical tool to characterize the new political systems on their own terms  I claim that this approach better exams the more or less democratic character of the building regimes in the period between elections  bringing to the fore the question of vertical accountability of the bureaucracies  issue unsatisfactorily treated by democracy theorists  The policy process approach allows as well for the identification of different types of democracy which differently combine characteristics of decision making  Finally  with reference to the Brazilian case  I consider the type of political regime the emerging countries are able or willing to build  offering some working hypotheses to analyze them
