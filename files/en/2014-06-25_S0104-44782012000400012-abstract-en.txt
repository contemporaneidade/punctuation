This text presents the results of socio political research on the construction of a field of arbitration in Brazil  The first part focuses on mobilization around legal arbitration as a  political cause  involving lawyers  professor and politicians connected to business associations and liberal institutions  resulting most importantly in the materialization of an institutional framework for arbitrating practices  Law 9307 which was promulgated in 1996  A second dimension focuses on authors and publications on arbitration  indicating the dissemination of ideas and disciplinary specialization that unfolded over the course of the 2000s  In the third part  I look at the place that arbiters occupy in Rio Grande do Sul  researching factors that condition their development  This is qualitative research that privileges several data bases  such as legal  journalistic and academic publications  curriculi vitae and semi structured interviews  My most significant findings lie in foregrounding the legitimation difficulties that this model of conflict mediation faces vis vis the judicial system  in the case in point
