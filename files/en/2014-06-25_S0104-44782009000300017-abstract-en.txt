Modern science has employed a self explanatory semantics that takes a variety of analytical strategies and levels into account  At the level of scientific organization  the sociology of science has made use of distinctions such as science society and interest  disinterest  These theoretical forms of observation are undergirded by the notion of the social context of the production of scientific knowledge  Nonetheless  literature on the sociology of science has not given enough attention to basic differentiation  within the world system of science and technology  between center and periphery  corresponding to a territorially differentiated context of scientific and technological production and whose influence is also extended to the content of locally produced scientific knowledge  This article revisits the literature on the sociology of science  technology and scientific knowledge  emphasizing the way in which these areas of research treat the above mentioned differentiation  Furthermore  it also attempts to present theoretical discussion on the usefulness of the center periphery distinction for sociological study of knowledge and the way in which this differentiation intersects other types of differentiation  including its effects on the very content of scientific knowledge  The article argues that the sociology of scientific knowledge in Brazil remains timid insofar as the study of the content of scientific knowledge in the periphery of the world system of science and technology is concerned  In Brazil  the  curse of normal science  prevails  a conception that is rooted in the local imaginary which asserts that there is little to be known regarding the content of autochthonous knowledge  Contrary to this view  this article encourages studies of science  technology and scientific knowledge in the periphery  in such a way as to specify the original content that the latter has contributed
