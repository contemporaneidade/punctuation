The aim of this paper is to examine the articulations of the traditional political culture  understood as  civic culture  and of the  New Political Culture   NPC  while cohabiting the same metropolitan area  The central question is whether it makes sense  in a country  like Brazil  with little time of existing democracy  to develop a concept to capture the NCP that is adapted to our idiosyncrasies  This effort will involve a theoretical and methodological discussion on the concept of political culture  as well as a discussion on the adequacy of new design of the NCP to a metropolitan culture of recent democratic tradition
