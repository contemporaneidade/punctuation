Based on network analysis  this article identifies the actors in peripheral positions within S o Paulo civil society and examines their different logics of performance and their relational or interactional strategies towards other actors  Findings of a survey with 202 civil organizations in the city of S o Paulo show that community and neighborhood associations keep the most peripheral positions  preceded by service non profits and forums  of middle centrality  Those actors are characterized by the superposition of structural disadvantages  However  this article shows that organizations occupy peripheral and middle centrality positions for distinct reasons and fulfill different functional vocations  It also shows that civil organizations deal with their peripheral and intermediate condition in different ways  even reducing considerably the relational constraints to their capacity for action and decision by establishing selective ties with organizations in highly central positions  Therefore  the article goes beyond the mere identification of positional hierarchies  developing nuanced formulations about the modus operandi of the organizations examined
