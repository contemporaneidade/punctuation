The purpose of this article is to examine the empirical validity of two propositions  which are related by the definition of democracy as a regime in which rulers are selected by elections  first  that democracy is a political regime distinguished by the accountability of rulers to the ruled  and  second  that elections are the mechanism through which this accountability is enforced  The authors consider that rulers are accountable if the probability that they survive in office is sensitive to government performance  On the basis of data for 135 countries observed  with a few exceptions  between 1950 and 1990  the authors estimated the probability that a head of government in democracies and dictatorships survives a particular year in office given the length of tenure and economic outcomes  On the basis of this analysis  they conclude that the assertion that democracy induces accountability is at least too broad  that elections do not enforce economic accountability in democratic regimes  and that the link between democracy and elections appears to be less than definitional  The authors conclude the article by suggesting a number of plausible explanations for these results
