This paper discusses the complex relations between education  identity and social change  focusing specifically on the life histories of Simon Bol var  Benito Ju rez and Ernesto Guevara  The reconstitution of their biographical pathways  supported by recent sociological theories on the constitution of social actors  allows us to identify some of the key features of their identities and  simultaneously  to rethink how different socializing experiences are combined in the formation of individual identities and dispositions in creative and tension provoking ways  The article s main thesis is that this combination of divergent social reference points is not only possible  but is promoted by  and represents  broad sociohistorical transformations
