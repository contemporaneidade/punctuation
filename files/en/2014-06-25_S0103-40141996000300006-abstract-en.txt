corporate governance created by the voucher privatization becomes now to be apparent  with all agents involved increasingly asking for an institutional change of the existing regulation  third  that the  silent secondary privatization already proceeds in capital markets and hence  the structure of the property rights in voucher privatized companies is silently and invisibly changing
