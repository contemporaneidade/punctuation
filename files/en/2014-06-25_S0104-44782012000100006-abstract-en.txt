The purpose of this article is to analyze how developing States such as Brazil are faring in the ambit of globalization  We intend to show that globalization has largely not contributed in advantageous ways to developing states  due to their difficulties in building national power  In these cases  globalization itself can be used as a means to concentrate influence within industrialized States  making relationships difficult on both sides  We also intend to examine how these issues correspond to the role Brazil may represent as large scale ethanol and oil producer  Finally  we  seek to understand how the country can become a major producer of energy while at the same time building national power in the age of globalization
