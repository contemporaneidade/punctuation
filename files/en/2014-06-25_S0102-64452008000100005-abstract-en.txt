The appearance and consolidation of a critical studies approach on international security fortified the claim that international security problems are not merely related to objective threats to states  but are in deep connection with the relationship between the individual and human emancipation  In those terms  a solid security condition is primarily preconditioned by human emancipation  However  in what conditions do international security and emancipation overlap  The present article intends to explore the question  a topic that is not tackled by the endogenous debate of critical security studies  CSS  An interesting path to be followed seems to be the dialogue between cosmopolitan critical theory and cosmopolitan liberal theory  This article argues that an intersection  or continuum  of these two theories would be possible if CSS focused on dimensions of political liberalism that have been neglected  especially to think about a transnational based democracy and the possibilities of a transnationalized civil society
