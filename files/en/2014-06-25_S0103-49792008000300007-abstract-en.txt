This paper intends to bring some pointers on thinking in what measure the networks of social movements in Latin America present ways for emancipatory policies  To analyze the capacity or potential of social movements networks in this continent in the construction of emancipatory referencials  we started with the presupposition that material demands should be translated in symbolic representations  in order to approximate the actors to the networks  to allow the construction of collective identities and to create symbolic links of reference inside the networks  that make possible the convergence of their political lines  It was verified  still  how intersubjectivity is built in the networks starting from shared normative references and which are the main constituent levels for the empowerment of a movement network  Thus  we strive to verify how specific  located collective actors and with private demands become enlarged social movements of the point of view of their demands and of their territories of performance  with more universal policy lines  That is  how the passage of collective actions is being built restricted to social movements properly said
