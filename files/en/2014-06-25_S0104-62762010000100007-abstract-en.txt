Abstract  How do we measure phenomena that cannot be directly observed  The principal aim of this paper is to demonstrate why factor analysis technique is the best answer to this question  Methodologically  we use a database with different indicators of democracy to show how principal component analysis can be employed to measure the two polyarchy dimensions proposed by Robert Dahl  1971  contestation and inclusiveness  On substantive grounds  we hope to facilitate the understanding of factor analysis technique in Social Sciences in general and in Political Science in particular
