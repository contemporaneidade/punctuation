This article reconstructs Honneth s theory on the recognition of moral and social imputability and its complex articulation in identity formation and conditions of struggle  We look at the interrelationship between community of values and the moral conditions of juridical relations  In other words  ideals of justice and the criteria social groups employ in moral evaluations of their social milieu are more present when disrespect is felt than in terms of a rational critique of reigning principles  The challenge posed here asks whether these zones of normative conflict are able to gain visibility and inquires into the potential to articulate and coordinate a social struggle that can integrate semantic  symbolic  material and immaterial means going beyond the emotional and moral networks of daily transit and able to resist political cooptation or inadequate public translations of desires for recognition
