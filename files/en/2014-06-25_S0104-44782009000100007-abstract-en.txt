Brazilian literature on the  adventure of citizenship in Brazil  frequently suggests that the terms of the modern normative order were set up here in a peculiar form  if we consider them in relation to those prevailing in what are referred to as the modern societies of  the center  As an indication of this  exceptional nature  allusions are made to the supposed particularities of the institutionalization of political  social and civil guarantees and obligations in Brazil  the routes taken  the historical sequence that has ensued  the actual depth and breadth of every one of them and of the bases that sustain them  are seen as proof of  Brazilian normative deviance  The present article represents an effort toward critical review  I begin with a specific and selective consideration on recent literature on  citizenship in Brazil  meant to indicate some of the difficulties and analytical dilemmas  This is followed by a problematization of what I consider to be two of the main theoretical anchors of Brazilian social thought  in order to shed light on elements having a decisive influence on interpretations made regarding modern Brazil s alleged  normatively exceptional  character  Finally  I argue for the need for an analytical emphasis on the contingent dimension of citizenship building  in order to avoid  essentializing  approaches to the processes that define our normative order  For these purposes  I will make some historiographic incursions meant to illustrate the type of attempts that have been made to deal with such dilemmas through the operationalization of two key ideas  on the one hand  the notion of political opportunities and on the other  the idea according to which rights and duties are not only juridical categories but also situated practices
