The goal of this article is to present contractualism as a method and as a result of the systematizing of other methods for constructing knowledge  While classical contractualism takes its paradigms from the geometric and mechanical models of Galileo s physics and from Descartes   particularly  the latter s model of rational choice   Rawlsian contractualism takes its paradigm from several micro economic paradigms  and that of general equilibrium in particular  The contractualist method of the 17th Century has making politics and Law into a scientific discipline as its project  considering that  during this epoch   i  the prevailing model of knowledge is the geometric one and knowledge is definite knowledge   ii  the prevailing model of the individual sees the latter as rational and moved by self interest   iii  it entails a theory of rational human action and decision making  Therefore  in order to make the project of turning politics and Law into science more viable  contractualism is not interpreted here substantively but instrumentally  as a method to access the bases of the political world  The contractualist method pursues a combination of the scientific model of knowledge of efficient causes and their relationship with effects  with the model of knowledge of ultimate causes as the study of ends or of the functional characteristics of things  In order to interpret contractualism as a method  we accept the new model of the relationship between knowledge and technology that has been elaborated by modern science and which maintains that knowledge of nature is a knowledge of conquest and domination that is capable of producing technological mechanisms for intervening in nature  with the goal of uncovering and manipulating causes in order to obtain the desired effects
