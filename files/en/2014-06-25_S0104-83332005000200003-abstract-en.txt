In this text I present central perspectives and approaches in the international debate about the trafficking of persons  and highlight some of the main points of critique about the contemporary hegemonic framework that are articulated through action research projects and grassroots anti trafficking interventions  I argue that despite substantial shifts in global understandings about trafficking  which are heavily influenced by two distinctly different feminist discourses  radical feminism and transnational feminism  today much of what is pursued in the name of a war on trafficking has troubling consequences for poor communities around the world  and has gendered and racialized implications  US anti trafficking policies are drawn upon here to illustrate some of these tendencies
