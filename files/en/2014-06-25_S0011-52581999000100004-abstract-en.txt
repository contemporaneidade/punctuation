This analysis of the reform processes that have occurred in New Zealand s  Italy s  Japan s  and Mexico s electoral systems begins by examining the initial context of each reform  It then describes the changes put in place and observes subsequent effects on party systems  Reform took a common route in these four countries  that is  some type of mixed system was adopted  where each voter casts two ballots in the Lower House  the first is cast for candidates who run in single vote districts under the plurality system  the second is cast for a proportional closed list  which may be national or state provincial in scope  The article strongly questions the thesis that the effects of institutional changes can be controlled  since relatively similar electoral reforms have had different consequences in the cases analyzed  In New Zealand  such changes brought significant improvements to existing institutions  In Italy  the only evident effect was the breakdown of the previous party system  In Japan  one sole party no longer dominated the system  which developed instead into a moderately fragmented one  Lastly  in Mexico  one could not say the system is effectively democratic but one can detect a trend towards party diversification and less manipulation of the polls
