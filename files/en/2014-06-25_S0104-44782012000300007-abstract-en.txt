This article compares participatory budgeting institutions in four Brazilian cities  Porto Alegre  Belo Horizonte  Recife and Curitiba  The three former cities use participatory budgeting while the latter holds public hearings in which proposals are made for budget related legislation  namely the Bill of Budgetary Guidelines   Lei de Diretrizes Or ament rias  LDO  e and the Annual Budgeting Bill  Lei Or ament ria Anual  LOA  Our goal is to analyze to what extent the institutions we study move close to the normative premises of the theory of deliberative democracy  according to which the legitimacy of political decisions and processes flows from free public deliberation which people take part in as equals  Our empirical research considers the following dimensions of our variables   i  institutional design  institutional framework and functioning  conditions of participation  discussion and deliberation   ii  context  degree of civil associativity for each city and the configuration of the political groups that implant the participatory arrangements   iii  politics  the scope of social representation and participation and  iv  accountability  transparency and responsiveness that these public forums make possible within civil society  Among our most important findings  we have seen those that are closer to the principles of deliberative democracy are those whose experiences have been built from grass roots civil society and implanted by political groups with an explicit goal of increasing social participation in public deliberation  The prevalence of a technical bureaucracy that presides over participatory processes has exactly the opposite effect
