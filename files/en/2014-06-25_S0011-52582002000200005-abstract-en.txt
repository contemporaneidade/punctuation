This article challenges the interpretations concerning participation by Brazilian legislators in the budget process focused on incentives generated by the electoral legislation  We show that the rules and regulations governing the budget process affect the distribution of funds both between branches of government and within the legislative branch itself  Constitutional and legal rules preserve the original proposal submitted by the Executive  Within Congress  the bylaws favor collective participation of members  for example  by way of submission of amendments by State representations  We further show that participation by the legislative branch in the budget process can only be understood when the political parties are taken into account  Coordination of efforts by the political parties thus ends up grouping them in two major blocs  pro administration and opposition  In other words  partisan participation in the budget process depends on the parties  relations with the Executive  Thus  the strategy adopted by the majority supporting the Executive takes into account their contribution to the success of policies sponsored by the administration of which they are a part
