This paper will develop three themes  First  I show that the democratization  federalism  and nationalism literatures have been developed in relatively mutual isolation and that we can only make more meaningful and powerful statements about comparative federalism if we relate the three literatures to each other  Second  I demonstrate that all federal systems constrain the lawmaking capacity of the democratically elected legislators at the center  However  I argue that it is analytically and politically fruitful to study democratic federal systems as existing along a demos constraining to demos enabling continuum  I also make a strong case that at all points in the continuum  federal institutions can have a great impact on policy  I can not develop these arguments without directly addressing and confronting the most influential political scientist who has written on federalism  the late William H  Riker  Riker s classic and still influential arguments about federalism stand in fundamental opposition to those I advance in this paper  Once these conceptual and methodological debates about federalism have been addressed  in the third part of the paper  I construct and operationalize the analytic framework of the demos constraining continuum  by evaluating four propositions about federalism  using data from India  Germany  Spain  the United States  and Brazil
