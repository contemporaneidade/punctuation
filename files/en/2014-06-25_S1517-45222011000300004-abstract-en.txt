In the last two decades  social movement scholars have brought the frontiers of the field into question  Some have advocated for the substitution of  social movements  for  civil society  while others have proposed to rename the field as the study of  contentious politics  In both of these cases  the justification is that the field of social movements has become too narrow  empirically as well as theoretically  The article discusses these reformist initiatives and identifies a problem they have in common  the lack of attention to numerous forms of interaction between actors involved with social movements situated both outside and inside the state  We offer a theoretical discussion based on the results of empirical research undertaken in Brazil on this issue  which  we argue  help us better understand the relationship between states and social movements  We also argue that the recent literature on social networks provides analytical clues to think about activism from within state structures
