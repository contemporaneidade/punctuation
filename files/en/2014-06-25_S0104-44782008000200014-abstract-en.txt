Our goal is to investigate the reasons behind the presence of clientelist type practices among the popular classes in Brazil  highlighting the decade of the 1990s  Our proposal gives salience to factors regarding the phenomenon s socio political conjuncture  thereby taking us beyond explanations that rely exclusively on historical cultural aspects or that sustain an economic bias  We use bibliographic and journalistic sources  from which we develop our own interpretation of the period  Thus  we observe that clientelist practices are encouraged to manifest themselves at the level of national political organization   particularly within the federal sphere   yet are also reflected at state and municipal levels  due to the coalition of political forces created through the implantation of a neoliberal project in Brazil  The latter has joined  modern  Brazilian social democracy and  old  regional oligarchies situated primarily within the PFL  PP  PTB and certain sectors of the PMDB  whose representatives are known for their attachment to patrimonialist and paternalistic practices  The inclusion of the latter in the  conservative pact  that has promoted neo liberal political reform has thus meant awarding new value to such practices  Herein lies partial explanation for the vigor with which practices such as  fisiologismo   apadrinhamento  abuse of state machinery  buying and selling of votes and clientelism have manifested themselves on the national scene over the course of the 1990s
