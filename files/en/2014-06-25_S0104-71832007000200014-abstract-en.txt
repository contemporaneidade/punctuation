Our paper aims to study the behavior of consumption of book collectors  Through ethnography we investigate the world of the bibliophiles that frequent two second hand bookstores in the city of Porto Alegre  The fieldwork has revealed some aspects that go beyond a utilitarian approach of goods acquisition and usage  Our analysis is based on previous works in Consumer Behavior and Anthropology of Consumption  This framework has permitted us to access a universe of consumption  which include male sociability  obsessive consumption  and the building of an identity through the consumption  The main contribution of this paper lies in the analysis of one extreme way of consumption  which can help us to understand some aspects of consumption in contemporary society  especially the symbolic proprieties of goods and the process of appropriation of goods in their moving from production to consumption
