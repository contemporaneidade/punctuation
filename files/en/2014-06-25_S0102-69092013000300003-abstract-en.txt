Drawing on archival materials and personal testimonies  I reconstruct the conditions under which Bourdieu came to receive the Gold medal of the National Center for Scientific Research  France s highest science prize  in 1993 as a signal case study of the existential predicament and institutional trappings of scholarly consecration  Bourdieu s award speech and the ceremony at which he read it present a triple interest for the history and sociology of sociology  They illustrate how a shaping figure in the discipline personally experienced  reflexively viewed  and practically navigated the nexus of science  authority  and power  They mark 1993 as a pivot year in Bourdieu s intellectual evolution  leading to a new agenda foregrounding the state as paramount symbolic power  the alchemy of group formation  and the unfinished promise of democratic politics  and they help explain why he ventured more forthrightly into civic debate in the 1990s  Bourdieu s ambivalent acceptance of the prize also illustrates his conception of the  Realpolitik of reason  and put an emphatic end to the eclipse of Durkheim by restoring sociology to its rightful place at the scientific zenith in the country of its birth
