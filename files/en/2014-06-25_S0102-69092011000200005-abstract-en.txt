The understanding that there are two distinct regimes for the production of software is increasingly common in literature  What is not so common  and is therefore the most original contribution of this paper is  on the one hand  the historical approach to the configuration of those regimes and  on the other hand  the analysis of the factors determining the technical and commercial success of one regime over the other  Furthermore  we have worked with two additional hypotheses  first  that the development of free software historically belongs to the public scientific knowledge production regime   i e  free software mimicking the organization of the scientific community because it has its historical roots in it  and secondly  that in a  market competition  environment the public and scientific regime has proven more efficient and has therefore forced companies working in the private business regime to adopt free or open source software
