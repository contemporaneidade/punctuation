While delineating the parameters for anthropology of art  the famous Alfred Gell s book  Art and Agency  left apart most of the anthropology authors  what arises some embarrassing and rarely dealt with questions  is it possible to produce good theory with no references to achieved knowledge in this particular field  The subjects within anthropology are so differently undertaken that doesn t make any sense to refer to common ways of approaching them  What exactly we loose which a narrative so self centered  Is my point of view that theory cannot be treated like a list of sentences that can be added to one another according to its isolated importance  This article proposes an analysis of Alfred Gell s narrative  of how he connects its propositions  I will examine  overall  his readings  the authors he quotes  like Peirce  Sally Price and others  and how he fits them on his argumentation  The objective of this exercise is to put in evidence some conceptions about art contained in his formulations  not only in his own definitions  and to enlarge the range within which we consider references to build anthropology of art
