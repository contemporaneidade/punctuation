What makes people commit crimes and socially deviant behaviors  Are such acts the result of idiosyncratic personal characteristics or a deformed acculturation process in the pre adult phase  Or could they be the result of social breakdown and injustice  On the other hand  one could postulate that such phenomena are the result of the rationalization process  whereby the modern culture of individualization provides the ethical underpinnings for opposing the Golden Rule  How  then  does one explain the occurrence of such phenomena throughout history and in different places and cultures  This paper provides a summary of different contributions and also reviews some theoretical models concerning the determinants of crime and their relationship to several empiric studies
