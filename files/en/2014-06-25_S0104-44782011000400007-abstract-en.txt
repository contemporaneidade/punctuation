This article explains the People s Republic of China s policies of international cooperation for space exploration activities  In the first place  given the tri polar power structure of the international system and the increasing dependence that all countries have on the use of outer space  we can explain Chinese motivation for spatial cooperation as unfolding from the search for security  economic development and legitimacy  Next  we demonstrate the Chinese spatial program s current state of development  with particular attention to image  navigation  communication and data transmission satellites  as well as micro and nanosatellites  Given structural incentives  strategic goals and the current level of technological development  we seek to provide a correct interpretation of China s multi lateral agreements at the global level  within the context of the United Nations  Committee for Peaceful Use of Outer Space  CPOUS  and within a regional context  with the recently established Asian Pacific Space Cooperation Organization  APSCO  Similarly  we are able to understand the meaning  potential and practical limitations of Chinese bilateral cooperation with Brazil and South Africa  regional powers located outside of Asia  We conclude that Chinese space cooperation is meant to increase Beijing s international influence without generating exaggerated reactions from other major powers  Thus  China attempts to postpone the militarization of space  seeking partnerships with regional powers who are still newcomers to the field  while keeping the future and expectations linked to the impact of digitalization into account
