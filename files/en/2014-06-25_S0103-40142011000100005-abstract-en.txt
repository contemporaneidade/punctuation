The text  referring to the Metropolitan Region of S o Paulo  puts a focus on the urban environmental issue  in whish the environment consists not only of natural processes and dynamics  but also includes the relations between them and the social processes and dynamics  Two extreme situations highlight the matter  i  the outlying settlements on the fringes along the water supply areas and environmentally sensitive areas  ii  the decrease of population at the central and consolidated areas  which have a potential to increase density  From this point  the urban projects made for the central area of S o Paulo  the core of the metropolitan area are discussed  It turns evident then that the inclusion of the environmental dimension in the urban issue  in a sense that is not just rhetoric  brings to light the intrinsic limitations of Urban Policies
