The paper proposes a definition of ethnography in Rickert s terms  an anthropological narrative that is a  synthesis of reality  or rather a  concept of reality  Its function is to reduce the complexity of reality in order to allow it to be perceived and to be thought  In this sense  all ethnography is a  reduction  an efficient tool for the anthropologist who recognizes the problem of the relationship between explanation and unpredictability of reality  but who refuses to give up the idea of science as a way of organizing knowledge
