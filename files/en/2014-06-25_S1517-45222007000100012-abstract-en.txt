This article examines the relationship between professional trajectories after dismissal and professional attributes accumulated during professional activity  It is a research study conducted in 2003 with 20 workers dismissed from the industrial areas of mechanic and transport material in the city of Caxias do Sul  The working hypothesis is that technological innovations in the industry s labor processes place new demands in terms of professional attributes to workers  expressed in contracts  thus impacting on the possibilities for professional repositioning  At the same time  given specificities of industrial restructuring now ongoing in Brazil  it is assumed that the new demands do not extend to all work positions  thus alleviating difficulties for professional repositioning  By rebuilding the trajectories of the workers investigated  it was seen that most of them returned to the manufacturing industry  as well as those that did not have distinct attributes regarding the work with microelectronic equipment or the educational levels required by the job market  Information collected also revealed that other elements interfered in professional repositioning  such as the existence of open positions in the job market and the establishment of personal bonds
