This paper reviews the context  causes  and consequences of mistrust of politicians in Latin America s current democratic era  In terms of context  we demonstrate that the very low trust in politicians in Latin America is merely one aspect of a syndrome of low trust across the board  In terms of causes of mistrust  we review three prominent features of democratic development over the past 15 years  poor economic performance affecting most new democracies in the region  corruption scandals  and the instrumental use of political institutions by incumbents  In terms of consequences  we examine the weak and uneven support for democracy across the region that appears to be causally related to mistrust of politicians  However  we avoid alarmism by arguing that these findings must be contextualized in light of the multidimensional low trust syndrome of Latin America discussed above  Moreover  the reservoir of authoritarian attitudes is fragmentary and is rarely expressed coherently in political action  And finally  research on both advanced and emerging democracries has recently demonstrated that citizens are increasingly willing to separate their evaluations of incumbents  often negative  from their evaluation of democracy as a regume type
