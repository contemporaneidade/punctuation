The article describes some new ways in which the Brazilian middle classes fit socially into the  world of neoliberalism  In recent years these layers of society have been prompted to believe that the traditional civil service job or  more recently  careers with large companies are no longer possible or desirable  These former pretensions have been replaced by the idea that franchising is the thing of the future  On the other side  the notion of  employability  has gained ground  through carefully thought out career management and the accumulation of knowledge and skills  the agent can become  economically viable  In cognitive terms  the latter trend is the opposite of the former and gains stability through its negation  In analyzing the evidence  the author focuses on the historical antecedents and symbolic operations that work to lend the situation coherence  He also endeavors to identify connections with the economic sphere
