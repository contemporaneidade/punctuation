This article attempts to systematize some contributions from contemporary theory  Schumpeter  Riker  McGann  Przeworski  Cox  McCubbins  Powell  Crisp  Arato and Lijphart  among others  on the limits of preference aggregation and on the most propitious institutional bases for the development of accountability  Through this analysis  we seek to demonstrate the link between minimalist theories of democracy and their normative bases  and in particular  the value that is placed on the dimension of accountability  It is our hypothesis that there is no absence of normativity in the minimalist proceduralist Schumpeterian conception of democracy  We have tried to show this through analysis of the relationship between institutional design and accountability  We seek to demonstrate how the institutional design of democratic regimes influences the formation of the characteristics of a democracy  which can be understood as indicators of the quality of democracy  in other words  the normative dimension of democracy  Our analysis unfolds through the differentiation of majoritarian and proportionalist designs and the institutional and normative characteristics that are tied to them  attempting to make contemporary arguments on the impossibility of preference aggregation and the relationship between institutional design accountability explicit  The methodology we use consists of systematizing central arguments and carrying out theoretical analysis of the books and articles of selected authors
