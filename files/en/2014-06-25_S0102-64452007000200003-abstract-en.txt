This article examines the formation of the Brazilian Northeast region  set in a long temporality  from the colonial era to the current days  It is in disagreement with two main views of that process  The first one considers the Northeast region as an historical entity existing since the colonial times  The second reduces the region to a criation of its oligarchies in order to ensure their privileges  their domination and the presevation of their power  Located in between such views  this article offers another way of interpreting the Northeast regional formation  laying it on the historical plan  In that way  the formation of the region issues its entire meaning when we link it up with the political chronology  which is also the political chronology of the formation of the Brazilian nation
