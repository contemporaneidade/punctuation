This paper aims to present Brazilian foreign policy thought in the Second Empire and in the First Republic  It is argued that Brazil s position in bilateral relations with great powers from 1845 to 1866 and in multilateral conferences from 1906 to 1907 is enunciated t hrough the particular universal and civilization barbarism antitheses  By means of the former  policymakers inscribed the country within the scope of an intra European pattern of relationships  debating among themselves the limits international norms could impose to sovereign practices  By means of the latter antithesis  policymakers repudiated Brazil s inclusion in the group of countries subjected to an extra European pattern of relationships  Instead  they affirmed an imperative of modernization of society by the state  aiming at avoiding the disregard for Brazilian territorial sovereignty and at legitimizing the country s insertion in the intra European pattern
