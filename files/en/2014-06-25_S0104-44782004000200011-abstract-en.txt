This article takes up the debate on arguments that maintain that a process of judicialization of politics is currently underway in Brazil  It focuses on three goals  discussion of arguments on the judicialization of politics in Brazil  evaluation of empirical arguments on the process of judicialization and suggestions for new approaches to the topic  The literature on this issue borrows Tate and Vallinder s definition of the term  judicialization is the reaction of the Judiciary to the provocations of a third party and has as its goal the revision of a decision made by a political power taking the Constitution as its bases  In carrying out this revision  the Judiciary would be widening its power in relation to that of the other spheres of power  Our view argues that it is necessary to come up with a better way to structure the indicators of a possible judicialization of politics in Brazil  In order to back up our argument  we will take another look at the arguments developed in Tate and Vallinder s anthology  The Global Expansion of Judicial Power  1995  We intend to demonstrate that the arguments that these authors use do not exhaust the issue  but to the contrary  they just manage to initiate the debate  In this vein  we will develop an approach for understanding the reasons underlying the socalled expansion of judicial power  This will be followed by a brief analysis in which we will attempt to verify if the conditions for the emergence of a judicialization of politics  as observed in other countries  are also present in Brazil  Then we will go on to discuss the concept of the judicialization of politics and its empirical bases in our country  Finally  we will take a brief look at other possible approaches to this problem
