In this dialogue held in the mid 1970s  Pierre Bourdieu and the Algerian ethnologist  writer  and poet Mouloud Mammeri  1917 1989  explore and explicate the social bases  uses  and meaning of oral poetry in Kabyle society and history  thus illuminating the peculiarity of oratory and the social conditions of symbolic efficacy  As the son of the next to last amusnaw  sage  bard  of his tribe  Mammeri is uniquely placed to situate this master of words who served the traditional function of mediator and carrier of knowledge  and stood as the living incarnation of tamusni  the practical philosophy of Berber excellence  in relation to the marabout  bearer of the sacred scriptures of the Koran  and to the peasants who composed his main audience  Becoming an amusnaw occurred by election and entailed a two fold apprenticeship  first by osmosis in a milieu saturated by verbal commerce and contest  in the armourer s workshop  the village assembly  the markets and pilgrimages  and  later  through explicit training with a master poet setting out a series of exercises and exams  It required not only commanding a set of verbal techniques and an oratorial canon but also imbibing and embodying wisdom  Playing on the multi layeredness of language  adapting with flexibility and   propos to the specificities of each occasion and audience  the Kabyle bard was continually tested and his cultural skills endlessly refined  to the point where he would not only master the rules of the craft but also play with them  transgress them within the spirit of tradition in order to invent new rhetorical figures extracting the maximum  yield  from language  Tamusni thus emerges not a body of inert knowledge cut off from life and transmitted for its own sake but as a  practical science  constantly revivified by and for practice  The poet is the spokesperson of the group who  through his cultural discernment and expert use of language  perfects the specific values of the group  separates things that are confused and  by shedding light on things obscure  mobilizes the people
