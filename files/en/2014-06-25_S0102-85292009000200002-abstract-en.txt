The complex relationship between the process of trade liberalization and the environment is  nowadays  one of the most important issues found at the international affairs agenda  Much has been discussed  but few conclusive answers on the so called environmental impact by free trade have been drawn  This paper has beseeched establishing a direct relationship between the increase of both the commercial activity as a result of economic liberalization and the environmental degradation levels  This research has led to the core conclusion that environmental effects of trade liberalization are ambiguous  having shown the impossibility of asserting  as a general rule  the existence of a direct relation between free trade and environmental degradation  We have also concluded that an accurate analysis on the issue will depend on the individual study of each case due to its complexity and subjectivity
