This article pursues two main objectives  First  it aims to deliver the first transnational overview and analysis of participatory budgeting  which in the literature on citizen participation or more specifically democratic innovations  occupies a central place  Second  it combines this broad empirical project with a theoretical approach based on the construction of ideal types in the Weberian tradition  Namely  it presents six models of citizen participation  participatory democracy  proximity democracy  participative modernisation  multi stakeholder participation  community development and neo corporatism  Despite these models are initially conceived in close connection with participatory budgeting and the European context  our contention is that they can help to investigate at transnational scale the socio political and ideological dynamics  contexts and impacts of civic engagement and democracy today
