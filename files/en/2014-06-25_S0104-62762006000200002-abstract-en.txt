The slowly changing nature of the gender gap responds both to significant social changes  such as urbanization  education  the entry of women into the labor force  and democratization  as well as to concerted efforts by social movements and political leaders to broaden women s right  These factors have clearly played an important role in the Dominican Republic over this past decade  impacting the country s gender gap  We assess the nature and evolution of the Dominican Republic s gender gap over the 1994 2004 period employing data taken from four nationwide public opinion surveys in the Dominican Republic   the Demos surveys   conducted in 1994  1997  2001  and 2004  The analysis of these surveys indicates that elements of what has been termed a traditional gender gap remain in place in the country with regard to civic engagement  political interest  and attitudes toward democracy  At the same time  this gap disappeared with regard to voter participation in elections and a modern gender gap emerged for the first time with regard to attitudes about the role of women in politics  Age and education have consistent and substantial differential effects across the attitudinal profiles of Dominican men and women over this time period
