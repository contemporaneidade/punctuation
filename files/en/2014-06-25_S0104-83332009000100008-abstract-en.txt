The main objective of this work is to help overcome obstacles which prevent a more efficient scientific production and improvement of the work conditions and cooperation among men and women scientists in knowledge creation  The preliminary results of the State University of Campinas  Unicamp  case study indicate no real differences by sex concerning the students learning abilities and academic commitment in careers considered to be male dominated   the hard sciences  mathematics  physics  chemistry  biology  engineering  etc  In fact  at Unicamp where differently from other universities there is a predominance of hard science courses  female students have outperformed their male counterparts in the majority of Unicamp s courses  Thus  the little interest shown by female candidates in the choice of hard science careers when applying for the university s entrance exam  is certainly biased by cultural habits and prejudices intrinsic to the different ways of raising girls and boys
