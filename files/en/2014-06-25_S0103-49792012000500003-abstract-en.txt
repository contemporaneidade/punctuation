The paper explores a series of distinctions between mental states that might be cognitively relevant  as well as between those that might be  self presenting  so as to analyze the relations between these and the external world  and understand the types of beliefs and epistemic judgments for which they allow  The paper also aims to reconsider the  perhaps epistemic  status of contentful sensory experiences  The goal of the journey is to face skeptical objections to epistemic justification akin to those raised by the Agrippan trilemma  according to which reflexive evaluation cannot regress infinitely  be infinitely circular  nor depend upon some arbitrary instance  It is also question of clarifying  with the relevant nuances  the relation between judgment and freedom a clarification that is of import to the more general question of epistemic agency
