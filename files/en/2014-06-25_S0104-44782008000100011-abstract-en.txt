This article examines the conditions and the dynamics of the use of technical abilities in political activism  Notwithstanding differences pertaining to different approaches  one of the constant themes within both national and international literature deals with the growing importance of educational resources and of technical legitimacy in recruiting and selection for leadership positions within environmental organizations  Based on research on the main leaders of environmental mobilizations and organizations between 1970 and 2004  we have seen that the use of technical abilities for the exercise of leadership functions has been a result of the dynamics of an increasingly diversified higher education system and of the greater articulation between educational background and political engagement  as leaders position themselves within a range of organizations and  social movements  over the course of their family  educational  political and professional trajectories  The methodological procedures employed here consist of biographical interviews carried out with leaders of different types of environmental associations meant to capture the itineraries that have led them to political engagement  the meanings given to professional training and the types of resources and social ties that support their conceptions and activist practices  Our main conclusions demonstrate that  rather than  technical activism  the situation is characterized by a strong interrelationship between the exercise of technical functions within environmentalism  a simultaneous participation in multiple networks of organizations and  social movements  and occupation of positions in different social spheres as based on the resources and political ties accumulated through such participation
