This article aims to link the theory of discourse developed by Laclau and Mouffe to the analysis of contemporary law  According to the proposed by the article  contemporary law is victim of a crisis that destabilizes its foundations  justifying their study under a post structuralist approach  For this task  the articlemobilizes the notion of hegemony developed by Laclau andMouffe  but links the abstract reflections of the authors about society in general with three dimensions of legal phenomena in particular  1  The judicial institutions and their relationship with the socio political environment  2  The practices of jurisdiction and litigation  and 3  The judicial decision itself  For the first dimension  I will use the work of Nonet and Selznick  For the second  I will take the legal theory of Dworkin  And  for the third  I will make reference to some important recent decisions of Brazilian Supreme Court
