The central argument behind this paper is that there is an   expiration date  for the effects of the iron law of oligarchies  a proposal that Robert Michels coined in his 1911 book  Political Parties  In the first section  we sketch out the social and institutional bases that served as a propitious context for turning the European socialist parties of the early twentieth century into oligarchical parties  the expansion of suffrage and the integration of candidates without property or high income into electoral competition  combining electoral reform with the substitution of majority vote for proportional representation  This was accompanied by shifting the making and organizing of candidate lists to the hands of party leadership  In the second section  we seek to provide some nuance to Robert Michels  somber prognosis on party organization  considering the factors that contribute to a greater or lesser delegation of internal power to party leaders
