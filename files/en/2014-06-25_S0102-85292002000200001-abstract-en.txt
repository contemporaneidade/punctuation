It is a commonplace to observe that the study of international relations is strongly driven by current events  So what implications do the events of September 11 2001  and their aftermath  have for the way in which International Relations is studied  Is September 11 a transformative event  like the Second World War  or something less  such as the Cuba missiles crisis  In particular  how does September 11 affect the claims of mainstream IR theories  and the balance of power among them  This paper reviews the claims of neorealism  globalism  regionalism and constructivism  taking them together as a set of partial truths that collectively constitute the framework of debate about international relations  It argues that each line of theory can and has claimed relevance in explaining September 11 and its aftermath  and that these claims are by and large valid  It concludes that no mainstream theory has been invalidated  that no new theory is needed to fill gaps exposed by September 11  and that neither the balance of claims nor the nature of the tensions amongst these theories has been changed  This is not to argue a case for complacency about the state of IR theory in general  Like the Cuba missiles crisis  September 11 does suggest that a focus on the internal processes of foreign policy making in the US will be particularly important
