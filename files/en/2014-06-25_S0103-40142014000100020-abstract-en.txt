This essay is an attempt to interpret  O espelho  a short story by Machado de Assis  from two stances  the canonical sociological reading and an existential reading  According to the former  the protagonist s experience is understood in terms of an overwhelming social role that molds his identity from the outside in  In the latter  the very same experience leads to the emergence of a despondent consciousness that is both negative and critical  The dialectical character of the second reading  however  is not a Hegelian overcoming of the initial stage of the process  but rather a coexistence of opposites
