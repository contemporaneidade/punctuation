Grasping the relations between the city  intellectual life  the university and the theater through the prism of the social history of culture and gender relations requires close attention to the characteristics of social experience and its retranslation into specific symbolic forms  Whilst the relationship between theater  the university and the city signaled diverging paths in some contexts  in others those routes converged in formal and social similarities  as I hope to show in this paper by analyzing the situation in S o Paulo during the 40s and 50s   a time that saw the implementation of a cultural system without precedent in Brazilian history  Hence the decision to juxtapose two distinct experiences  those of theater and intellectual output  in order to underscore the sociological warp that aligned them synchronically in the same cultural weft
