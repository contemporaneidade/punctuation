This paper explores the construction of self identity in relation to others in a Bolivian Amazon society  through the lens of the ambivalent attitudes of the Ese Ejja towards non indigenous Bolivians  I argue that the Ese Ejja s ambivalence reflects the mutable  contextual and relational nature of identity  understood as self image  The relationship described here is characterised by self debasement on the part of the Ese Ejja  This is partly attributable to historical  economic and political factors  but is also consistent with the indigenous strategy of avoiding direct confrontation with dangerous entities  Moreover  it is suggested that this stance towards powerful foreigners can also be read in terms of indigenous socio cosmological notions of otherness and of Other becoming and of the Ese Ejja s own sense of being in history
