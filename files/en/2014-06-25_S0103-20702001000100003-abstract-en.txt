The text aims to show  based on a commentary of Adorno s points of view on the goals of education  that the history of modernity  seen as process for the constitution of the hegemony of instrumental reason  has removed an essencial feature from education  the formation of a consciousness for freedom  an aspect that is involved in the relationship between experience  truth and happiness  which constitute the humanist ideal of knowledge and emancipation  Civilizing progress can be seen as a progressive loss of the ideal of formation  substituted by the procedures of adaptive rationalization of the individual to the alienating conditions that are peculiar to the managed world  In the event of an impossibility to reinstall the favourable conditions to the cultivating education experience  we are left  from a critical education perspective  with an attempt to oppose the instrumentalization of subjectivity by means of an effort to recuperate the negativity as a counterpoint to the blind adhesion to the historical present
