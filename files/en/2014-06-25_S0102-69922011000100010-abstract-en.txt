This paper results from an analysis of the associative engagement for the recruitment and legitimization of political elites  The different modalities of the relations with unions and associations are examined considering the federal deputies who have taken their positions from 1999 to 2007  These relations are compared to other conditions and resources such as those related to schooling degree  the amount of economical property  partisan affiliation and the number of switching between political parties  According to one of the general conclusions  there is a strong homology between the distribution of federal deputies according to their associative relation  both in partisan politics and in the political environment  However  this is not simply a dichotomy between activities  associative and political partisan scopes  but rather different patterns of complementarity  elective affinities  ambivalences and detachment  and therefore different patterns of resources and modalities that could be used in different conditions and processes for politization
