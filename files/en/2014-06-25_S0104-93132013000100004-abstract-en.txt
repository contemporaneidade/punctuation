Based on ethnography undertaken in a neonatal intensive care unit  I reflect upon the relationship between body  substance  subjectivity and person  My intention is to demonstrate the medical staff  s unconscious calculation of  substancialization  of the baby  This is the idea that from  based upon a baby s weight  it can be recognized as a person endowed with subjectivity  Before this attribution of social existence  the premature newborn infant is seen as the mother s subjectivity less appendix  I aim reflect here upon the formation of the body as a prerequisite for the formation of personhood  I compare my ethnographic data with theoretical approaches that indicate a process of systematic anticipation of the attribution of personhood  which have been made possible by advances in reproductive technologies
