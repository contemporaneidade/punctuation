The purpose of the article is to undertake a critical analysis of the democratic peace approach laid out in Oneal and Russett s Triangulating peace   democracy  interdependence and international organizations  2001  This study offers a theoretical framework to explain a supposed international  fact  and attempts to incorporate and control some variables of the main approach it seeks to challenge   structural realism  The article argues that Oneal and Russett fail in their two main attempted contributions  The causal mechanism identified by the authors does not withstand resist the understanding  derived from Clausewitz s theory of war  of war as an integral political phenomenon  Incidentally  this criticism also applies to other prominent works on the democratic peace  given these share the same assumptions  Furthermore  the authors are incapable of identifying and controlling the  realist  variables as planned  which makes them vulnerable to the criticism of epiphenomenalism
