Approximately 30  of the species of frogs and toads are threatened with extinction  and indeed 35 of these species are already extinct  As they present thin and permeable skin and  in most cases  live their larval phase in an aquatic environment  these animals are very sensitive to alterations both of the aquatic environment and of the soil and air  The greatest generating factors of such crisis are the life style of our current society   which produces high pollution levels   global warming  invasions of exotic species  the increase in the incidence of ultraviolet radiation  and the emergence of epidemics  If awareness about human responsibility for this crisis is not raised and no changes in human life style take place  this threat will reach all species  especially humans
