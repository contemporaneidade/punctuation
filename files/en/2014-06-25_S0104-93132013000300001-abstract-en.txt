This article reflects on the relation between anthropology and philosophy  starting from the central characteristics of ethnographic description and the importance of the symbolic dimension to social life  Taking as its reference the different manifestations of social life and the diversity of societies and groups  or social segments  studied by anthropologists  the article examines the conditions of intelligibility of ethnographic work as an issue that spans anthropological research wherever it occurs  As such  it permanently imposes a reflection  of a philosophical character  that seeks to account for concrete  well circumscribed and empirically delimited problems  With this in mind  the article first explores the conditions for the intelligibility of witchcraft practices as studied by anthropologists  and concludes with a discussion on the intelligibility of juridical disputes and the demand for rights in modern societies
