Industrial entrepreneurs formed with public bureaucracy a political pact that was dominant in Brazil from the 1930s to the 1980s  National developmentalism was the development strategy that they adopted  The economic and political disaster that represented the Plano Cruzado and the world hegemony of neoliberalism since the 1980s were determinant in their loss of power  Fiesp and Iedi were unable to present an alternative discourse to the dominant neoliberal one  Since the 2000s  however  and particularly since the Lula administration  there are signals that they are reorganizing their discourse and giving it a macroeconomic content more consistent with the control of inflation and economic growth
