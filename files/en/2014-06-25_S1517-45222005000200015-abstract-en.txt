This paper is an overview of the influence of Donald Pierson  formed in the Sociological School of Chicago  which had more repercussion on urban research in Brazil in the 1930s and 1950s  both within Sociology and Anthropology  in the city of S o Paulo  Urban research in Brazil   both sociological and anthropological   had theoretical references that left their marks on the works of that time  According to my argument  regarding the scientific fields of anthropology and urban Sociology in Brazil  one of the theoretical trends in a certain historical and theoretical context was the Sociological School of Chicago  Revisiting pioneer urban studies in S o Paulo could assert the influence of the School of Chicago  In spite of being isolated studies  they have strongly stressed properly urban issues  It would be risky to define them these days as Urban Sociology in its own right  in S o Paulo  The reason for bringing them up is to demonstrate that they really represented antecedents to urban studies in Brazil between 1035 1950  Therefore  I can say that the sociology of the School of Chicago had its impact on three fields in Brazil  a  racial relations  blacks  whites  and immigrants  b  community studies  small rural towns  and c  studies in the city  especially in S o Paulo  Therefore  I think of the city of S o Paulo as a scenario in general terms  as an agenda for institutional research in 1935 1950  Among the few and modest sociology studies having the city of S o Paulo as their object  an ethnography of the city or urban ethnography was conducted that was different from classic studies on communities or small rural towns  Initially  we have eight works published mainly as journal articles  and their research object was some neighborhoods in S o Paulo or other cities  The main feature of the article is the extensive bibliography found and presented at the end of the text  about the impact of the Scholl of Chicago and its repercussion in Brazil
