The paper develops epistemological implications of the idea that  when a theory is in state of abstract formalization  as to day physical theory  quantum physics for instance is  the meaning of its concepts and propositions  which are aiming at the representation and intelligibility of the external physical world is however to be taken from within the theory itself    It is the theory itself which dictates the physical significance of its propositions  in the words of Heisenberg and Einstein  It contains also the analysis of what is meant by   formalized theory  for a science with empirical content as physics and concludes that it cannot be reduced to a mere  interpreta formalism  in the sense of logical impiricism  Finaly it works on the sense of endoreference connctions with a kantian concept of a priori synthetic
