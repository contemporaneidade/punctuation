The purpose of this paper is to examine the way in which  through its Observers Missions  OM OAS  the Organization of American States  OAS  has been institutionalizing practices of representative democracy in the Inter American system  By looking at the Peruvian elections of the year 2000  the article demonstrates the limitations of democratic principles when they are confronted with the principle of nonintervention that has been maintained through the defensive action of middle sized powers  such as Brazil  and small State actors  Organizations such as the OAS have been incorporating democracy into their agenda with an intensity that is uncommon to their diplomatic history  The article concludes that such an explicitation of democracy on the part of the OAS does not always breed positive results  There a number of constraints present  such as the institutionalization of monitoring procedures  the political and economic interests of the regional powers and the always tricky problem of the boundaries between monitoring and nonintervention in internal affairs of member countries
