The article aims at recovering the terms of the critical dialogue about more general concepts of political theory  such as power  domination  State  sustained by Nicos Poulantzas with some representatives of the  American political sociology  Our basic hypothesis is that the originality of some of Poulantzas  contributions in his early works is strongly related  among other things  to the dialogue with such authors who formed the mainstream of the academic political science at the time  As an additional proposition  we argue for the need of resuming that critical dialogue and of systematically incorporating into the theoretical universe of the structural Marxist political sociology some of the major categories developed by pluralist and systemic political scientists  such as those of power  influence  authority  political system and political elites  In this sense  we argue against the arguments put forward by some analysts about the existence of a radical incompatibility or a  zero sum  relationship between notions employed by political scientists of these two theoretical traditions
