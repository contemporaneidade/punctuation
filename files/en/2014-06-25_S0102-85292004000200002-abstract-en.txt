The author tries to explain why intra state conflicts are less likely to be successfully concluded by peaceful settlements than inter state conflicts  The author affirms that his main hypothesis is that those peace processes fail because they insist on building states as the only possible political space  The author argues that the missing link in the existing literature on conflict resolution is the social construction of identities involved in such conflicts  He discusses how different authors deal with identity construction before he settles for a position defended by Habermas  which relies on new ideas on communication  politics and the state  The author concludes his argument by evaluating the Dayton agreement in Bosnia  According to the author  the Dayton agreement cannot be evaluated as a failure since they managed to cease the hostilities and to begin the construction of a new political process that does not necessarily coincide with the state  The author presents the Bosnian evolution as a model to what might happen in Iraq after the US invasion in 2003
