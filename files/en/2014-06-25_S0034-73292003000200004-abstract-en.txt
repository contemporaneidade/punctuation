The main objective of the present study is to demonstrate that the Brazilian historiography has magnified the Brazilian responsibility in the events of March 1926  in the League of Nations  It overconcentrates on the motivations of the government of Artur Bernardes  without considering decisive aspects related to the international politics  specially the European international politics  and institutional issues of the League itself  Thus  it seems more important to look the Brazilian diplomacy from an international perspective  that is  to think about it in the context of the  fiasco  of international diplomacy itself  in the time of  the twenty years crisis
