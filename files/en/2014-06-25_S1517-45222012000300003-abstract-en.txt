The present paper reflects on the underlying logic of the so called  quantitative methods  applied to social sciences  The account of such underlying logic is framed within the efforts towards establishing the existence of a single comprehensive logic for both the most typical approaches to social sciences methodology  namely the qualitative and the quantitative  This single logic is pursued by means of Kuhn s concept of  scientific paradigm   1975  where methodological issues represent  while  work assumption  a particular instance of scientific paradigm  distinguished from other paradigms by the absence of symbolic generalizations  anomalies and  revolutions  and by the substantive role of procedural models  primarily regarding evidence provision  For this purpose  the paper presents a concise review of Kuhninan paradigms and  then  analyzes the so called quantitative methodological tradition in social sciences   particularly in sociology   in the light of such paradigms  and coining the term  causal methodological paradigm   CMP  Therefore  by means of the paradigmatic framing of these two approaches  though that of qualitative method is postponed to a future step in this research line  it will be possible to establish whether the interface between the two approaches meet the assumption of an underlying methodological common logic  In the affirmative case  the competing perspectives on issues of choice and composition between the two practices would be reduced   and even eliminated   thus contributing to the consolidation of mixed methods  qualitative quantitative  strategies  Finally  it is worth noting that CMP s underlying logic implies the combination of the concept of cause  in its broad sense  with the experimental model and its developments It does not mean  however  to assume that the instrumental role of qualitative methods in the own CMP relies on either the notion of cause  or experiment or whatever comparisons
