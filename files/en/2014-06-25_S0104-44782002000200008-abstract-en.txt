This article has three different objectives  The first is to present and discuss the crisis in the implementation of administrative reform policies  That is followed by a selective review of the main contemporary theories that deal with this issue  Third  another theory is suggested  one which relates the crisis in implementing reforms to the problem of the limits in obtaining cooperation simultaneously with program objectives of fiscal adjustment and institutional change  The theory that is proposed argues that the tension between greater bureaucratic flexibility  on the one hand  and the demand for more rigor in internal systems of bureaucratic control  on the other  is a powerful causal mechanism which tends to generate successive crises in the implementation of such policies  For this reason  reforms tend to generate organized resistance to change  coordinating problems  problems of collective action and so forth  The article puts forth the argument that although this explanation can be considered of general validity with regard to administrative reform  it could prove much more critical for management reforms in which the contradiction between the goals of fiscal adjustment and institutional change is much more intense
