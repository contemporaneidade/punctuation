This article discusses the relationship between liberalism and feminism through the work of two feminist scholars  Carole Pateman and Martha Nussbaum  This is an important issue for feminism  and one in which the problems associated with public private and nature culture dichotomies  inherited from liberalism  are fundamental  In this regard  we will discuss Carole Pateman and Martha Nussbaum s positions on the matter  Our choice of authors is due to the fact that both share many of same premises and conclusions  and because their divergences are located primarily around problems in which feminism is  added on  to political liberalism  Thus  in carrying out a discussion through both positions  we minimize the risk that the analysis of the debate move little beyond the critique that numerous theories have directed toward liberalism  and offer what can be a fruitful entry into one of the most controversial points in contemporary feminist theory  Nussbaum and Pateman seem to coincide regarding their conception of gender equality  In the criticism that both of them direct toward the nature culture relationship and to the formalism of abstract equality  it becomes evident that neither seeks to attribute either power or the oppression of women to nature s designs  In both authors  it is very clear that what they consider relevant for the organization of a just society in terms of gender is the way in which a society places value on biological differences and what implications this has for the distribution of social goods  Nussbaum  however  believes that this equation can be dealt with within liberal theory  as long as it is subjected to changes which free it from theoretical problems linked to the conservative stance of the first liberal philosophers
