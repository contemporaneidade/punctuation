This article intends to demonstrate that a good sociological approach to the  financial crisis  is to view the theme as a dispute between different social representations  rather than proposing an alternative explanation to the phenomenon  simply different from or complementary to those presented by the economists  I draw on information and assemble chronologies based on the situation in the United States  and particularly that of Brazil  I then suggest that there is not  a crisis  in the singular  but various narratives vying for primacy  and that this social game  first and foremost  provides the basis for the distributive conflict inherent to any capitalist society
