In recent years  a number of studies have examined the influence of public opinion on government policy  but few have considered the influence of opinion on social conditions  These are separate questions  since policies may not have the intended effects  and opinion may influence outcomes directly apart from government policy  This paper examines the relationship between public opinion and income inequality in a sample of about 50 nations  It finds that the distribution of income is more equal in nations where opinions are more egalitarian  and that this relationship is stronger in democracies  However  the association with opinions of people with above average incomes is stronger than the association with average opinions  suggesting that people with higher incomes have more influence  Analysis of the sources of national differences in opinion suggests that egalitarianism increases with economic development  contrary to the claims of many authors  Ethnic diversity and the experience of communist rule appear to reduce egalitarian sentiments
