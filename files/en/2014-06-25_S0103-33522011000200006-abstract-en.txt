This paper outlines and discusses three hypotheses on the relationship between politics and entertainment  It seems that as politicians have become media stars and artists have entered the political arena  it is necessary to clarify the reasons why this is happening  In this paper three ideas are summarized   a  Thomas Meyer s argument that  media has colonized democracy   b  John Street s view about the popular culture s political importance and  c  Liesbet Van Zoonen s notion of  convergence  between entertainment and politics  Finally  a brief critical account of these hypotheses is done to frame them into a larger picture
