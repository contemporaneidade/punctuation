This article is the result of a research study concluded in 2003  which aimed at investigating how the conception of Law is expressed in the actions of the so called social pastoral commissions of the Catholic Church in Londrina  Brazil  By observing that the conception of charity and that of social rights walk side bi side within the Catholic Church  a question emerged  how is the conception of social right expressed in the actions of social pastoral commissions  Charity is preached as a Christian duty  as an action expressed in the experience of solidarity towards others who are in a situation that prevents them from having minimal living conditions  At least at discourse level  the actions developed are not limited to provide basic goods  clothes or medicine  We realized that those who act in social pastoral commissions  driven by values such as love to fellow human beings and solidarity  have not lost sight of the idea of social right   on the contrary  they have been reinforcing it
