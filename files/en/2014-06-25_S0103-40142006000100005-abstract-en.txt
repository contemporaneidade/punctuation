THIS article reports the results of a political scenario building exercise carried out by the Institute of Advanced Studies within the framework of a larger project sponsored by the federal government  The authors first draw a positive scenario  characterized by political stability  improvement of the party system and of the legislative machinery  and better social policies  Next they turn to two negative scenarios  under which the above mentioned goals seem unlikely to be reached  The positive scenario is unlikely to come about without substantial political reforms  An effort is therefore made to analyze reform proposals debated in the country over the last two decades  with special reference to those aiming to strengthen the party system  improve Executive versus Legislative relations and increase accountability in the political system as a whole
