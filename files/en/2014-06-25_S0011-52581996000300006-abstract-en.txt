The article s main purpose is to study the pattern of interest intermediation in public health policy and  more specifically  to examine the relations forged between interest groups and institutional actors within differing decision making arenas during the evolution of the so called Brazilian Sanitation Reform which took place in 1985 89  In empirical terms  the analysis centers on the reform s decisive landmarks  to wit  Brazil s 8th National Health care Conference  the Unified and Decentralized Health care System  SUDS  and the Single Health care System  SUS  In methodological terms  the focus is on the strategic choices made by actors within the decision making process  Drawing an analogy between the myth of Pandora and the Brazilian Sanitation Reform  the analysis explores the reform s unexpected outcomes and their socially undesirable effects  The profile of public health policy that has emerged from this reform is one that reflects a paradoxical process of universalization and exclusion  in which the principle of social citizenship   grounded on solidarism and universal access to health care   has been steadily undermined  giving way instead to market logic as the prime via of access to health care  Perversely and paradoxically  the state has come to intervene in a selective and merely residual fashion
