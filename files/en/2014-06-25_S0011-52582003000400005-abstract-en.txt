Research on political institutions suggests that sub national factors affect the proclivity of legislators from the same party or coalition to vote together  We estimate the effects of such forces operating at the State level   intra list electoral competition  and alliance with governors  We propose that larger cohorts  in which the imperative for legislators to distinguish themselves from the group is stronger  should be less unified than smaller cohorts  We also derive from theoretical hypotheses that cohorts allied with governors may be either more or less unified than other cohorts  We analyze unity among coalition cohorts on recorded floor votes in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies  We find support for the hypothesis that larger cohorts are less unified  but detect no net effect of alliance with governors on cohort voting unity  Governors are not dominant brokers of legislative coalitions  suggesting that the net gubernatorial effect is contingent on factors that shape their influence relative to national level legislative actors
