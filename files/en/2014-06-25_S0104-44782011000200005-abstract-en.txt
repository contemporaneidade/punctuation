This article presents a reflection on the use of ambiguous argumentation in dealing with the theme of conflict in two classical authors  Machiavelli and Aristotle  The idea here is that both authors were forced to discuss the theme of social conflict in an ambivalent way  following a common directive of their time  criticizing conflict as the loss of order yet  at the same time  seeing conflict as a force that is capable of giving rise to a superior form of political order  In fact  in Aristotle  conflict may both breed class stability and the constitution of a virtuous form of democracy  the polity  and lead to the decadence of a constitutional order  In Machiavelli  conflict is at the root of the freedom that sustains the republic  with Rome as a model  as well as at the source of the spiraling disgregation of the republic  with Florence as its illustration  A suggestion for this debate is that such ambiguity  in this particular case  resides in the need to accomodate a metaphysical characteristic of these authors  analytical frame  that is  the circular nature of historical time  in tension with the empirical analytical requirements that the theories of the Greek and the Italian author were expected to meet  A comparison of Machiavelli and Aristotle is based on the fact that  notwithstanding enormous differences in their work   both dealt with a common issue  that is  the notion of the circularity of history as a problem to be resolved  toward more realistic interpretations of class conflict
