When one leaves Brazil for an academic experience abroad   Brazil  can become a strange signifier  a space one is supposed to represent but which one cannot completely recognize anymore  What is Brazil in a North American academic environment where Brazil itself is seen as part of a  Latin American  tradition that for most Brazilians is barely recognized as theirs  Is it possible that Latin America as a coherent symbolic construct is only pertinent from the perspective of an English speaking academic community  What does it mean to raise questions about Brazilian literature when we are abroad  These and other questions will be addressed here in order to ask if belonging is not the least pertinent of our most cherished feelings
