In the last two decades  social sciences have been registering and analyzing the growing appearance of a new way to codify the dangers and threats that characterize social life in contemporary societies  This consists of the proliferation of discourses and technical  political practices organized in function of risk  We can observe that there exists consensus in the sociological literature about the definition of risk as social construction and the complex relationships between risk and scientific   technical knowledge  This work especially discusses the socio   technical and institutional bases of risk as a device for arbitrage of social problems in such diverse levels as the selective provision of social services  determination of guilt and or danger in criminal behavior  allowance of credits in the financial system  management of human resources in the labor area  and others
