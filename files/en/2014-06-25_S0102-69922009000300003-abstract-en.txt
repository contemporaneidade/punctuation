Every society that classifies mankind and separates the autochthonous groups from the  foreign  groups includes a system of beliefs  being it religious or of another kind  Their representations obey a norm that gives their actions an ethical sense  Those actions are not committed by criminals or crazy people  but by the ones who know what it is allowed or forbidden  or what the difference between good and evil is  The starting point of the presented reflections is that stereotypes categories which discriminate groups in whites and blacks  Christians and Jews  Frenchmen and Germans  indigenous and Spaniards  gypsies and Rumanians etc  constitute  in short  a way of knowledge with the function of opposing the favorite  fellow creatures  to the despicable  different ones  to distinguish those who are not like us
