In this article I seek to provide a basis for understanding the process that triggered the change of the social position of samba in the 1930s  I try to show that a self referred framework of discussion about samba emerged at the heart of the development of the commercialization of the  product  popular music  which paved the way to the emergence of a set of debates whose participants were experts in discoursing about that new form of art  On the other hand  these agents both rivaled against and cooperated with other intellectuals who ventured to produce commentaries about the musical genre in question  These two categories of intellectuals shaped a dialogical interstice that promoted the establishment of several  truths  about the urban popular music  From the contacts  the conflicts and the cooperation drawn between them  historical junctures would be forged  restructured and reinterpreted  a fact that would enable new ways of vision  the eruption and crystallization of institutions and songs
