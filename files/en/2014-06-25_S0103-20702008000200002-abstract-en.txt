The theory of  religious economies  advanced by Rodney Stark  Roger Finke and Larry Iannaccone has received scant attention from Latin American academia  Few local works have assessed their arguments carefully and evaluated them according to their own definitions and presuppositions  In this article  I review their main ideas regarding rational choice  the dynamics of the religious market and its consequences for religious pluralism  This discussion is particularly important since their new definition of  rational choice  is virtually unknown locally  and their ideas about the religious market have been   more often than not   understood from the perspective of Peter Berger  whose position stands in sharp contrast to their own  Calling attention to the degree of regulation of religious economies  the authors show that these economies are not defined solely in terms of  monopoly  or  market  but that there is actually a continuum of possibilities
