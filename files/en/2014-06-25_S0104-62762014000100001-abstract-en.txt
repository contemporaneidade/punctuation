In this paper we investigate the patterns of electoral volatility  at the individual level  in the 2010 Brazilian presidential elections  We explain variation in vote intention before the first round between candidates Jos  Serra  Marina Silva  and Dilma Rousseff  A special emphasis is given to the effects of perceptions of corruption and abortion  two hot campaign issues  to explain the final result of the first round  The analysis is based on the first Brazilian Electoral Panel Study  BEPS  which has three waves of interviews with the same nationally representative sample  allowing for measures of how voters changed their minds during the electoral campaign  Results indicate that perceptions about corruption  primed by the eruption of corruption scandals  more than the debate on abortion  stimulated a loss of votes for Dilma Rousseff
