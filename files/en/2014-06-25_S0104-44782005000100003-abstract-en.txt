This article reviews and redirects the cross country empirical literature on the causes and consequences of decentralization and federalism  A  first generation  of studies viewed decentralization as a simple zero sum transfer of authority from the center to subnational governments  drew upon the assumptions of welfare economics and public choice theory  and employed blunt measures of expenditure decentralization and federalism  By defining several alternative forms of federalism and fiscal  policy  and political decentralization  then measuring them and exploring inter relationships across countries and over time  this paper paints more detailed pictures of decentralization and federalism that help explain the growing disjuncture between theory and cross national evidence  pointing the way toward a  second generation  of more nuanced empirical work that takes politics and institutions seriously
