In the course of the last 30 years  feminist theories of gender have shifted from quasi Marxist  labor centered conceptions to putatively  post Marxist  culture and identity based conceptions  Reflecting a broader political move from redistribution to recognition  this shift has been double edged  On the one hand  it has broadened feminist politics to encompass legitimate issues of representation  identity and difference  Yet  in the context of an ascendant neoliberalism  feminist struggles for recognition may be serving less to enrich struggles for redistribution than to displace the latter  Thus  instead of arriving at a broader  richer paradigm that could encompass both redistribution and recognition  feminists appear to have traded one truncated paradigm for another   a truncated economism for a truncated culturalism  This article aims to resist that trend  I propose an analysis of gender that is broad enough to house the full range of feminist concerns  those central to the old socialist feminism as well as those rooted in the cultural turn  I also propose a correspondingly broad conception of justice  capable of encompassing both distribution and recognition  and a non identitarian account of recognition  capable of synergizing with redistribution  I conclude by examining some practical problems that arise when we try to envision institutional reforms that could redress gender maldistribution and gender misrecognition simultaneously
