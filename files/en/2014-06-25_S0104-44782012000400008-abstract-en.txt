Within Political Theory  this speech presents Edmund Burke s conception of political representation  that is  the relations between elected representatives and their electors  Burke rejected the mandate of the imperative type in which representatives heed only local demands and proposals coming from electors  which they then reproduce within parliament  This would make them more akin to spokespersons with the right to vote than to politicians seeking the common good through rational debate with other politicians  In contrast to that model of representation  Burke proposes what today we refer to as  representative mandate  in which representatives are acquainted with local demands yet  without neglecting them  seek to join other representatives in composing general policies  The underlying rationale is that representatives together make up a parliament meant to serve the nation as a whole rather than one locale or another  thus  they should formulate policies that take the whole country into account
