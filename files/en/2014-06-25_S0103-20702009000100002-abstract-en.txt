Based on the literary exposition of the social meaning of the aging process  this innovative text combines a study of at least three dimensions of the topic  adolescence as a postponement of social functions  the relational formation of identity through the introjection of a social role  and the alienation indissociable with becoming part of the adult world  Alternating between descriptive account and analysis  while citing a series of contemporary events  the work maintains its freshness by sketching a phenomenology of the lived world  focusing on the specific meaning of professional careers under modern capitalism
