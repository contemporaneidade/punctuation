Distancing itself from the formal models that have served as an axis for studies of collective action and social movements  this article seeks to reinstate the lived dimension of political engagement  Basing itself on the ethnographic analysis of a set of neighbourhoods in Greater Buenos Aires  it explores the multiple and heterogeneous ways in which people become involved in the so called movimentos piqueteros  It indicates that these experiences become intelligible through their inscription in a wider plot of relations and possibilities  Starting from a figurational perspective  the text discusses some of the assumptions of the literature on piquetero organization  in particular  and social movements more generally  it questions that dichotomy between material reason and politico moral reason through which the question of the motivations of collective action have been addressed  it is mistrustful of a rigid opposition between the State and social movements  pointing to the creative   and not merely co optive   character of state policies  and  finally  it proposes to sociologize the locus of the  the pleasure of doing  in the origin and continuity of political engagement
