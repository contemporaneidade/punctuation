This article discusses the difficulties and dilemmas involved in managing the question of refugees in the contemporary world order  With this goal in mind  we discuss the institutional evolution of the norms and organizations that make up the international regime for refugees  elaborated within the ambit of the United Nations  UN  since the end of the Second World War  Throughout our presentation  we identify the origins of some of the problems that continue to affect the issue of how refugees are dealt with and highlight recent factors that add new difficulties to the regime s functioning  Finally  we conclude that the first challenges that must be confronted are related to the institutional design of the international organization  especially its mandate and sources of financing  Furthermore  in our understanding  the regime should be strengthened in order to deal more effectively with the problems that refugees experience today  Yet we also recognize that there are political obstacles that make it difficult to re open the debate on necessary changes in this international regime  The reformulation process should follow a route which promotes the shared responsibility of the diverse actors on the international scene  in order to include not only the UN but also States and global civil society
