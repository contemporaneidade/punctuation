In this article we analyse the theoretical distortions that emerge when the Brazilian democratic construction process is analyzed utilizing exclusively the institutional approach  This approach does not explain the ambiguities between the emergence of a market economy and a passive and distrustful society of their elected officials and political institutions  In that context  adverse political conditions are produced that do not contribute for the democratic strengthening and the institutionalization of a participative political culture  The question to answer is  is it possible to develop political capacity of citizens through social capital as an alternative mechanism of citizenship  The results of the data examined in this paper are not too convincing
