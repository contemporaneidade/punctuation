Executives frequently make policy by decree  by passing standard legislative procedures  Political scientists have been troubled by this process  particularly in presidential systems  where executives frequently do not enjoy the support of legislative majorities  and therefore where policy making by decree may entail the usurpation of legislative authority  We offer a theory of the conditions under which legislators should be expected to tolerate   and perhaps even prefer   policy making by decree rather than through the regular legislative process  A number of factors affect legislative preferences on decree  including the strength of the executive s veto  the independence of the constitutional court  the difficulty of amending the Constitution  the existence and cohesiveness of legislative majority parties or coalitions  and the urgency of policy issues  We conclude that the practice of executive decree by itself does not necessarily imply that legislatures are marginalized from policy making
