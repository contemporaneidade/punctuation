The essay investigates the theological political grounds of Euclides da Cunha s seminal work  Os sert es  with special emphasis put on the relation between messianism and potential construction of the nation  This paper does not simply apply the  theological political  model to the reading of the work  in order to prove once more the structural equivalence between theological and political concepts  More than that  it analyses the conflicts of the period on the basis of theological political exigencies  It thus understands opportunities and consequences of its ruins  in the double sense of caused destruction and of the ruin of the theological political structure itself  With regard to the complex Brazilian messianic tradition  this essay contributes to a new critical perception of the Os sert es role
