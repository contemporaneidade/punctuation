The theory of value was read until presently based on three broad analytical approaches  An approach before Marx  another approach by Marx and the Marxists and the neoclassicist approach  The one before Marx has as its central element the idea that value is a central category to societies with market or barter economy  that in capitalist societies would gain its most advanced expression in the process of wealth creation  In Marx  value is considered as the fundamental market economic category  However  this type of economy is assessed as transient  ie  there is a historical determination of the market economy that is directly linked to the existence of value  As for the neoclassicists  value is a category of economic activity in general  therefore  capitalist economic activity being a particular form of economic activity in general  Its main concern is  in these terms  directed to a general equilibrium supported by the marginalist analysis of value  However  the debate over value today seems to go beyond these classifications  Its recovery is summarized in the following question  do theses on new information technologies and immaterial labor converge to a new form of labor theory of value or to overcome this theory  The main purpose of this paper is to introductorily characterize the main theses of debate in social theory  which incorporate  update or deny the labor theory of value in the process of analysis of immaterial labor
