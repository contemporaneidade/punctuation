In this article  I propose to develop some considerations on the central debate that characterizes contemporary democratic theory  working on the one hand  with Schumpeterian minimalism  and on the other  with one of his rivals  deliberative theory  I start from the premise that  through the lenses of minimalism  democracy appears as a market  through the lenses of deliberative theory  it appears as a forum  Using these abstractions  I go on to bi dimensional figure that Dahl proposes  originally made up of two axes  competition  y  and participation  x  and now composed by the axes of market  y  and forum  x  The analogy is meant to bring out the crucial points in the theories dealt with  in the attempt to facilitate aprehension of the complex   and often confusing   web of discussions that surround the issue  I finish with the conclusion that it is possible to think of the debate within modern democractic theory as needing to focus  simultaneously  on both the minimalist and the deliberative viewpoints   market and forum   because the interpretation of democracy as market dos not exclude its interpretation as forum  just as competition  in Dahl  does not exclude participation  although both may vary independently
