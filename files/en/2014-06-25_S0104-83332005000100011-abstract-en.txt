This paper presents how the construction of corporeality takes place when a drag queen is passing through a  female impersonation  process  which may be seen as cross dressing  Some aspects of the discussion proposed here are the construction of the character  the learning of a female impersonation process  the process of making the changes required to the character and the construction of a drag corporeality  and their meanings for this group  The data presented here comes from my ethnographic fieldwork about drag queens which was done in gay and lesbian sociability places in the island of Santa Catarina  Brazil  from 2000 to 2002
