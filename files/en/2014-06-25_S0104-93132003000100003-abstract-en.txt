This article analyzes how the  personalizing pattern of social relations  archetypical of so called holistic or traditional societies   the core of the Brazilian national ethos and a structuring element of the collective life in  small towns    has responded to the  individualization process  provoked by the expansion of capitalism and its dominant values  Taking as its context the period during which Brazil inserted itself ever more forcibly into the competitive social order of the world system  the text reconstructs the history of factionalism   a prominent expressive feature of the personalizing pattern of social relations   in a small town of Minas Gerais between the ends of the 19th and 20th centuries  The aim is to relativize the conception that this process has led to a decline in the traditional lifestyle of the small town  but also to reject the idea that tradition continues unscathed by the passage of time  proposing instead that the dialectic between tradition and change makes explicit various modulation processes of the local ethos
