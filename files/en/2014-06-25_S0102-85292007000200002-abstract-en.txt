The objective of this article is to analyze the changes brought about by the foreign policy of Lula da Silva s first government  2003 2006  To discuss the topic  we will make use of Hermann s  1990  article on foreign policy change and the motivation behind it  integrating it with constructivist insights useful to examine the roles of the ideas in the formulation of the Brazilian foreign policy after 2003  To compliment our analysis  we will make use of three notions  autonomy through distance  autonomy through participation  and autonomy through diversification  These notions explain the main changes occurring in Brazilian foreign policy from 1980 through to the mid 2000s  We will conclude by demonstrating how the autonomy through diversification best applies to the aforementioned period  acknowledging that the first two levels of Hermann s theory  adjustment change and program change  did in fact happen  We suggest that the third level  problem goal changes  can come into effect with the consolidation and amplification of the first two levels
