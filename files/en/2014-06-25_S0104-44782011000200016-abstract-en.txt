In studies of US power  one fundamental aspect comes to the forefront  the construction of US leadership  expressed  among other things  through the creation and maintenance of international institutions that are able to establish an environment favorable for the exercise of this power during the 20th century  For our understanding of these processes  the concept of hegemony becomes essential  In this regard  the present essay attempts to examine three distinct interpretations of US foreign policy and inquire into how each one approaches the issue  We look at interpretations provided by Joseph Nye Jr  and Immanuel Wallerstein  in the United States  and by Cristina Soreanu Pecequilo  in Brasil  In particular  we intend to show   i  how each interprets American power and  ii  how the term  hegemony  has been used to explain this power in the 20th century  The three interpretations reflect distinct theoretical perspectives that have been applied to the analysis of American power  They are also inscribed within the production of a significant recent literature on US behavior and international strategy and the implications the latter have for contemporary international politics
