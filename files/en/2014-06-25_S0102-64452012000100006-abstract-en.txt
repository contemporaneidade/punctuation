Social scientists approach the role of race in Brazilian politics from diverse perspectives  its role in the making of the nation state  social movements  or race targeted public policies  This paper takes on race as a central issue and looks into race s effect on individual political behavior  Using the resource based approach as a framework  races does not seem to affect an individual s chance of participating politically in Belo Horizonte  whereas the possession of resources such as income and education substantially increases an individual s likelihood of participation  Despite these findings  it is argued that the resource based approach has a limited capacity to test all factors that lead to political behavior influenced by racial identity
