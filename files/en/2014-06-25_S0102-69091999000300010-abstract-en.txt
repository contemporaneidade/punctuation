The social trajectory of French Republican Victor Frond  1821 1881  together with his work as a photographer in Brazil and as editor of luxury illustrated books  underscore particular traits about the relationship between biography and portrait in the eighteen hundreds  His autobiographical narrative  written in a bid to win recognition from Parisian authorities of the Third Republic  suggests a portrait that is embedded in history  In contrast  in his biographical albums composed of notable personalities  the portrait surpasses the immediate context of the photographic pose  It floats above the events of the day  immortalising the subject  as it conceives the text as apology
