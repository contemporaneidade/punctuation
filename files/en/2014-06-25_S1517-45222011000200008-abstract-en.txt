The essay deals with the importance of the rediscovery of Karl Polanyi s thinking and of his criticism of the  market society  in resuming  rural  development studies and debates  Following an overall presentation of Polanyi s theoretical and analytical framework  we look for using his concepts to interpret the commoditization dynamics of the rural livelihoods and the social forms of labor and production in the rural space  as well as the commoditization of the agri food systems in the contemporary capitalism  Based on these statements  we reflect about the role of social actors and institutions in the processes of social change at large and of rural development in particular  And  finally  we propose some potentialities of this approach for the rural development studies in Brazil
