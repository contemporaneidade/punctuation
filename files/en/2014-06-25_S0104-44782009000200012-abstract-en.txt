In this essay  we question certain evaluations   which  we believe  are canonic in International Relations   of United Nations performance  This organization has  since its origins  been simultaneously considered both as  chronically inefficient  and as demonstrating  exemplary efficiency  In order to show this  we employ two types of  episteme  the first  manifesting itself in articles that have been published since the United Nations was founded in 1945  takes a systematic look at the supposed  crisis  of the entity  the second is related to the reiterated attribution of the Nobel Peace Price to the U N  over the course of the last six decades  for its alleged contributions to promoting peace and international security  From our point of view  this bipolar evaluation of U N  performance reproduces a pattern for analysis of international organizations that is common to the rest of the academic discipline of International Relations  The United Nations is praised and criticized from the vantage point of that which can be considered the institutional formula of modern politics por excellence  the national sovereign State  In conclusion  we argue that to evaluate the United Nations of the year 2006 from the vantage point of 1945 is dangerously inappropriate  The very standard concept of State demands  today  a redefinition of terms   in order to absorb the historical and social changes that have occurred over time  The challenge  therefore  is to offer perspectives for a new theoretical framework for looking at the United Nations   which  ideally  would be freed from the side effects produced by the approach we call  methodological Statism
