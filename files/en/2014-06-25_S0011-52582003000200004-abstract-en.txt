The Globo television network conducted extensive coverage of the 2002 election process in Brazil  During the 17 weeks between the end of the Football World Cup and the second round of the Brazilian elections  the Presidential race occupied approximately one third of air time on the network s main nationwide news program  Jornal Nacional  This was a marked difference in comparison to coverage of the 1998 elections  which were virtually absent from the Globo news broadcasts  The network also pursued a policy of clear impartiality towards the four main Presidential candidates  in stark contrast to its almost militant involvement in previous races  This article seeks to demonstrate that the influence of the Globo network on the election process in 2002 occurred primarily through its collaboration in closing off the discursive field  demanding that candidates assume an increasingly deep commitment to the continuation of prevailing macroeconomic policies
