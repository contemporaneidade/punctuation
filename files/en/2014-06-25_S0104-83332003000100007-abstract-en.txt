Analysing the daily political practices of a group of Legal Advocates   women of the working strata of Porto Alegre that followed the capacitation course in Human Rights   I was able to notice the different gender attributes revealed by their taking part in Porto Alegre s political context  These women negotiate and produce contextually new gender relations in a political field constituted by attributes culturally associated with the masculine  They do so either in the clash between different feminines or in the appropriation and instantiation of attributes of masculines  From the ethnography I undertook among this group of women  I propose a reflection on how their political practice generates different gender relations in Porto Alegre s political context
