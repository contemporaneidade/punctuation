This paper analyses data from a research done with automobile workers in the ABC region  in the State of S o Paulo  with special emphasis on those who are between 19 and 29 years of age  A comparison of their socio economic profile was made with that of their colleagues who are thirty or over  Pointing out the heterogeneity that characterizes youth  the text shows the existing differences  not only between the younger and the older metal workers  but also between the young metal workers and other youths that took part in previous researches  The analysis shows that  to a certain extent  those working in the automobile industry are better off than that other youths in the labor market in general  and in all senses  their situation is a lot superior to that of youths who have not been absorbed by the market  either because they are unemployed  or because they are underemployed  This does not mean  however  that these young metal workers are satisfied or that they are not fearsome of the uncertainties of a globalized world
