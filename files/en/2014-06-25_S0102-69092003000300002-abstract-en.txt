Both the appeal to some universal ethics and the evocation of a global civil society constitute the core of the  cosmopolitan democracies  theories  presented as either reality data or political desideratum  The paper aims at showing that in the terms formulated by the cosmopolitan democrats both ideas rely on evolutionist presuppositions  Institutions  values  and cultural ways of life effective on societies situated in the northern hemisphere end up being regarded as both per se superior and models for general application  Against such reorganization of the world  the paper indicatively cites necessary precautions in order to have both the international cooperation of social actors and the globalisation of human rights contribute towards overcoming particularisms in the several regions  taking into consideration  at the same time  the cultural particularities of the different regional contexts
