This paper reflects upon the hypothesis that a dramatic change is taking place in the way Brazil thinks about itself at the dawn of the 21st century  With the passage of recent laws on quotas for black people at public universities and the civil service  the notion of a mixed nation made up of  three races  seems to have been challenged  giving way to the idea of a nation divided between blacks and whites  For the first time in our history since the 1920s  the Brazilian elite seems to have shattered the foundations of the idea that allowed for the creation of our most radically nationalistic and cosmopolitan culture  The notions of a Modernist Brazilian character forged by M rio and Oswald de Andrade  Paulo Prado and S rgio Buarque de Holanda  Gilberto Freire and Di Cavalcanti  Tarsila do Amaral e Anita Malfati  is under suspicion  What does this change in our law mean  and how can it affect the structure of our society  based as it is in a set of values which does not emphasize opposition  but rather complementarity  giving precedence to that which unites rather than that which separates
