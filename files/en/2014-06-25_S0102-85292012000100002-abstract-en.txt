This article has two fundamental aims  The first is to evaluate how political regimes  and most notably the democratic character of some states  have been incorporated in debates on IR theory  We will evoke the traditional narrative of disciplinary evolution  with a specific focus on the systemic positivist North American tradition  The idea is to offer a critical reading of the way theoretical strands of International Relations face this  democratic  element  as well as its peculiarities and implications to the debate at large  We argue  in this sense  that the  political regime  variable loses explanatory power as the  third image  approaches reach the center of the disciplinary debate  The second aim  linked to the first one  is to suggest that considering democracy as a relevant political variable in relations between states is not incompatible with systemic approaches to international politics  especially when looking at the concept of identity in the Wendtian constructivism  On the contrary  cleavages such as democracy versus autocracy may enhance the explanatory power of theories when facing current phenomena
