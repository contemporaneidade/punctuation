This article proposes to take an historical inventory of the situation of the countries of the periphery over the last thirty years  looking specifically at the impasses in development belonging to the current phase of so called globalization of capital  It is based primarily on the study of an extensive literature of recent publication  We ask to what extent the return to development in the various stagnated areas of the periphery can be considered a concrete possibility and engage in a series of reflections around this issue  which we consider as fundamental for the present conjuncture  We seek to show that the economic stagnation that characterizes many non developed countries is due in part to the social and economic crisis that began in the decade of the seventies and continues to date  efforts to restructure capitalist society notwithstanding  Strategies and policies of a neo liberal type have also contributed significantly to this situation  to the extent that they have reinforced the financial knots that have suffocated a large portion of the peripheral economies  Adding to these problems  such countries have also been faced with the ecological limits of capitalism  Reinitiating development on another plane  involving economic growth  social justice and the preservation of nature would mean breaking with capitalism itself
