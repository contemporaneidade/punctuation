The article revisits modernization theory s convergence claim  which has been strongly criticized by multiple modernists  who maintain that emerging realities have not borne out its underlying premises  Based on a thorough reading of classical texts  the article reconstructs the term s meaning within a modernization theoretical frame of reference and then considers the evidence that multiple modernists hold against it  It finds that none of the observations cited by leading multiple modernists are able to challenge modernization theory  which can easily accommodate the kinds of difference invoked by its critics  East Asian modernity in particular  to which both sides assign special weight for any test of modernization theory  appears remarkably similar to Western modernity when viewed through the lenses of this theory  At the same time  the literature on multiple modernities  despite pleading to take difference seriously  is silent about differences that large parts of the less developed world exhibit vis a vis the West and East Asia in social structural and cultural respects  indicating different degrees of modernization  The article concludes with a brief note on the differential weight of different kinds of diversity for different reference problems and a suggestion for a constructive resolution of the conflict between the two approaches
