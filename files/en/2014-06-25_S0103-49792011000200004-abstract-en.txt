The paper aims to clarify  first  Adorno s critique of the association between negativity and totality in Hegel  to then show that  despite this criticism  Adorno himself does not dispense with the concept of totality with an explanatory function  Only on a micrological level Adorno s critique seems justified  in that the concept of totality is criticized as positivation of contemporary society  Thus  his work on the negative dialectic exercises two distinct uses of the concepts of negativity and totality  which can be combined by means of his conception of totality as a socially necessary illusion
