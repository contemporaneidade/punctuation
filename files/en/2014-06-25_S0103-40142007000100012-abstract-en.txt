In the last 30 years  the production of ethanol from sugar cane in Brazil reached 17 million cubic meters and it is expected to achieve 35 7 million cubic meters by 2012 2013  This growth has taken place due to great technological support by means of production  imports  adaptations and internal transferences  An analysis of the different phases of this development  with the evolution of its technological parameters and the great competition of the sector  is presented in the article  Nowadays  foresights state that the sector may keep evolving with continuous improvements  but sudden technological boosts are also possible through the development of technologies directed towards a better use of the residual biomass of sugar cane  which represents about two thirds of the total biomass  Studies in progress indicate that the sugar cane contribution to energy supply may be superior and more diversified than the current one  They also affirm that this may happen together with bio refinery development  which will result in products of higher aggregate values
