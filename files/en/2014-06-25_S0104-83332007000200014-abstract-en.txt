This work discusses and questions some processes of production and propagation of maternity representations  having the National Bolsa Escola Program as its starting point  and localized in the field of cultural theory  mainly from the perspectives of both Cultural Studies and Feminist Studies  with a critical approximation to the post structuralist analysis  In order to carry out the work  I have selected a series of television advertisements used to publicize the Program in its first year of implementation  I have explored these advertisements in order to analyze the different ways through which maternity has been represented and meant  I have discussed how a set of teachings and proposals was publicized in the Program so as to be mainly developed by the families  thus relocating women mothers and children s education into the center of those debates
