The paper addresses the operative place of memory in self knowledge  Making use of classic references  particularly those stemming from the dispute between empiricism and rationalism  it aims to show that knowledge of the own self  which is only attainable by introspection  is relatively poor  Opposing dual structures of presentation of the problem  the paper suggests that the clarification of what can be considered self knowledge and introspection requires the consideration of the role played by memory and the evaluation of the epistemic nature of postdictions  i e  statements about past events in this case  about mental past events  By way of non definitive conclusion  distinguishing self knowledge from self knowledge by introspection  the paper claims that self knowledge by introspection has at least three characteristics  it has a dual temporal structure based on memory  it is direct  and it has first person authority
