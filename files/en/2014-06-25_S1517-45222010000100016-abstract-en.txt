This review intends to identify the main ideas of Zygmunt Bauman s Liquid Times  In this sense  the key issue that permeates the work is uncertainty  A phenomenon that results from the  desire for freedom    which is a sign of the postmodernity  in the words of the author   that principle is directly opposed to that which is based on a stable social life  in the modern world  In a globalized world  society is no longer protected by the State  or at least it is unlikely to trust the protection on offer  it is now exposed to the rapacity of forces it does not control and no longer hopes or intends to recapture and subdue  Thus  the book under review contributes both to the understanding and comprehension of the social phenomena that surrounds us  and to an appropriate interaction  with predictable effects
