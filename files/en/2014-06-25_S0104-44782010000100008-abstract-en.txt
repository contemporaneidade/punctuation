Maintaining members of the military and increasing their prerogatives within the ambit of the public security issues are criteria that limit civil autonomy in areas of management  planning and strategic actions in security  This authoritarian legacy in the Federal Constitution and within some institutions of coercive power  particularly the Ministry of Defense and the Brazilian Intelligence Agency  Ag ncia Brasileira de Intelig ncia   ABIN  has led to the non consolidation of democracy in Brazil  since civilian control therein remains quite fragile  In this regard  the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the process of militarization of public security has limited Brazilian democracy  Even after the country s re democratization through sub minimal patterns  public security continues  in a very accentuated way  to remain in the hands of members of the military  This creates a lack of civil controls  an attribute that would be necessary for the consolidation of democracy  as well as serious limitations in the defense of citizens  rights  Observing such details  I observe that the current framework of Brazilian public security offers no more than a semi democracy
