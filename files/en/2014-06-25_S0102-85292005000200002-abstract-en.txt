Drawing on a post modern post structuralist approach in International Relations  this article aims to make an analysis of the UN s decision taken in April 21  1994 about the establishment of Unamir as a response to the violence in Rwanda  We emphasize the assessment of the ethical responsibility of the organization  in terms of the radical re articulation of the concepts of ethics  responsibility  and subjectivity  as proposed by Emmanuel Levinas  We look for the implications of that decision in terms of the consequences it permitted   that is  the Rwandan genocide  the increasing of the violence over time allowed by Turquoise Operation  and the reorganization of the genociders in the refugees  camps  Besides  we intend to look upon a deeper theme  which underlies the permissive conditions of those tragic consequences  the sovereign territorial state principle domination in the contemporary political imagination  The hard boundaries between inside outside  state refugee camp  domestic international derived from that principle imposed also a compartmentalization in the arena of formulation of policies to deal with the humanitarian crisis that followed the genocide  This fragmented way to deal with such a complex and multifaceted problem  for its turn  resulted in politics that distorted the priorities and undermined the effectiveness of the assistance programs  as well as alienated the newly installed government
