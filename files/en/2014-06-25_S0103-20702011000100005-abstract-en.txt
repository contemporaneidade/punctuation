In this text I present two modalities of suffering experienced by adolescents responsible for committing offenses while in detention  especially when caught in a kind of intermediary zone between life and death  In the first modality  suffering turns into a political act of self rebellion  a suffering resistance in which the subject passes from victim to witness  In the second modality  the pathologization of the adolescents turns their experience of suffering and rebelling bodies into increasingly isolated  individual and disempowered acts  Subsequently I focus on the ethical political dimension of two experiences of suffering  highlighting the presence in contemporary Brazil of an extreme overlap between mechanisms of sovereignty  authoritarian society  and biopower  making some live  the citizens  and others die  the enemies  one in the name of the other  Finally I suggest the need to  re politicize the violence committed and suffered by young people as a form of denaturalizing youth violence
