Among nineteenth century authors  sociologist Fr d ric Le Play  1806 1882  stands out for the research methodology he developed to study European workers  In the perspective of the history of sociology  and in a dialogue with some of his twentieth century readers  I analyze Le Play s concept of family and its intimate connection with his findings  The so called family monograph method  as the name indicates  intended to learn the living conditions of workers in different European countries by monitoring the life of some of their families  I intend to show how the construction of concepts  methods and survey and data analyses techniques enabled the systematic reproduction of his observations  both by Le Play himself and his uncountable followers  In his methodology  the family is the core concern  and will enable future generations of both social scientists and historians to revisit them in their studies
