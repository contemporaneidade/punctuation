In this article I aim to explore how identity is constructed among penitentiary agents  based on the dynamics found inside prisons  but also taking into account the relation with society outside  Two aspects are highlighted  The first concerns processes within prison and how the work of penitentiary agents is perceived by wider society  The second refers to social transformations more generally  based on the analysis by Wacquant  1990  who argues that the expansion of the prison system   i e  the emergence of the Penal State   occurs in parallel with the shrinking of the Social State  This approach enables a multicausal understanding of the phenomenon of punishment  including issues ranging from the procedures and reflections referring strictly to punishment to others not directly related to the phenomenon  but connected to it
