The aim of this paper is to understand the main features of the complex Jewish system of dietary laws  With this in mind  the following topics will be discussed  1  their social function as to when new members join Jewish orthodoxy  with the resultant reformulation of the group boundaries  and 2  their symbolic function in the Jewish religious system  which gives more emphasis to ritual practices rather than beliefs or faith  These two topics will be illustrated with the data gathered through a long fieldwork carried out among the new orthodox Jews of S o Paulo during the years of 1999 through 2001
