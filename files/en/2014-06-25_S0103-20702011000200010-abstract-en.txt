This article analyzes the clashes over socio environmental projects financed by the World Bank since the beginning of the 1980s  It focuses in particular on the relationship between the Bank  the American Congress and Federal Government  and NGOs working in the USA  It argues that the Bank responded to external pressures in relation to socio environmental issues by increasing in size and activities  through a conflictive and continuous process of institutional stretching and incremental change that accommodated these pressures within the dominant paradigm  On the other hand  the confrontation that marked the relations between the Bank and the NGOs through the eighties later gave way to institutional partnerships for the implementations of projects and programs in the wake of the neoliberalization of Nation States
