The slums and the walled condominiums express the duality of rich and poor living in S o Paulo metropolitan area  The occurrences of those settlements begin  in the case of slums  in the first half of the XX century  and    in the case of the walled condominiums and developments  in the 1970 s  This paper intends to analyze and to identify both the spaces of homes in condition of extreme vulnerability  particularly the slums and habitational units in precarious outlying neighborhoods  and the ways of structuring the space for living for the rich and the middle class  highlighting  preferentially  the walled horizontal condominiums  as real state forms that represent the two extremes of the current socioterritorial inequality in the urban and metropolitan context of S o Paulo  We will also think about the new forms of space appropriation for rich and of poor living  trying to understand if there really is a new pattern of occupation of soil in the S o Paulo Metropolitan Area
