The main objective of this article is to revise some questions involving the history of science  particularly physiology and sociology  in reference to the concept of system  developed during the first decades of the XXth century by Vilfredo Pareto in sociology  1916 1917  and  in physiology  by Lawrence J  Henderson and Walter B  Cannon  both of them from Harvard University  The article argues that Pareto s sociological system did not avail itself of original analogies of other sciences  It also shows that L  J  Henderson identified in the social system put forward by Pareto the same epistemological foundations of complex systems  Besides  it suggests that Pareto s concept of system is very similar to the concept of homeostasis put forward by Walter B  Cannon in 1932
