This article presents a discussion on Policy Websphere Analysis as a methodological approach for analysis of organizational arrangements and the relationships they express through cyberspace  in an attempt to make the logics underlying political policies within the context of political networks explicit  Through this approach  we present the results of research aimed at apprehending and interpreting the relational logic of sociopolitical practices meant to facilitate societal dissemination of information and communication technologies  as sustained through the norms and values underlying organizational arrangements  in Porto Alegre and Curitiba  We present a reticular morphology of such arrangements  using of tables that have been put together through websites and hyperlinks and which  in essence  constitute the representative means for potential spaces of political interaction and the socio political values communicated by organizations that are articulated in governance arrangements represented in virtual space  In our view  the most important contribution made by Policy Websphere analysis  at least until the present  consists of the possibility for delimiting new spaces for the presentation and discussion of ideas  actions and projects  These spaces have acquired an ever  greater importance in political networks  actions in processes of public governance
