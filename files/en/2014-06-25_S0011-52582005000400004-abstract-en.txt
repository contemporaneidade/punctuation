The paper argues that unlike the predictions of the literature on second generation reforms  there occurred an important change in the pattern of social policy during the Cardoso years  with the attendant improvement in social indicators  The budgetary process has been increasingly and extensively hardwired  inter governmental relations have undergone extensive restructuring  and the line ministries in the social area have been insulated from coalition building politics  It argued that the change was determined by the broader transformation of Brazilian federalism caused by an extensive process of constitutional reform  and that the executive had both the incentives and the capabilities to promote it
