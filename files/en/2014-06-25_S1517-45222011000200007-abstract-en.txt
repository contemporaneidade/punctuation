The bio economic paradigm can be described as those economic activities which capture the latent value in biological processes and renewable bioresources to produce improved health and sustainable growth and development  This article is a critical review of the impact of the emerging bio economy in rural development  It describes some of its consequences in the sphere of agri food and regional innovation based on a specific  and in our opinion weak   definition of Ecological Modernization  The central question then is  what are the conceptual roots  driving forces  empirical expressions and implications of bio economic development  We argue that although the bio economy makes severe sustainability claims  it also shows some missing links  has some negative environmental and social side effects and runs the risk of a one sided economy  We plead that the alternative trajectory of eco economic development can be a serious alternative for especially vulnerable places  who want to increase their resilience
