This work intends to demonstrate how the large expansion in the higher education system all over the world since the 1970s results in the incorporation of market logic in the system of public management for higher education  However  such feature of public policies that has marked the vast majority of systems for management of higher education in contemporary societies has allowed isolating universities that enjoy academic reputation from those policies  keeping them as exclusive niches for members of social elites  The analysis of the Brazilian case shows an even more dramatic picture than the international one  since here  having higher education increases rather than reducing the effects of original status on social economic status
