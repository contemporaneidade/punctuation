May a business man support a left wing political party  To answer this question  the author defines left as the political ideology that accepts to risk social order in name of social justice  If this is done moderately  if the political party adopts a center left position  there will be no inconsistency  In modern democracies  political parties on the left and on the right fight for the support of the ideological center  and tend to converge to it  What to say on that question in the case of Brazil  Here  as in Latin America  moderate left wing political parties often win elections but seldom govern  This paradox is explained by the conservative character of Latin American elites  Latin America is formed of dependent countries striving in a highly competitive world where national strategies are required to grow  In principle  one would expect that the left would be a national left  but since the  dependency theory  declared that a national bourgeoisie was impossible in Latin America  an alliance between progressive business men and the left became more difficult but  also  the left and the intellectuals tended to become dependent or cosmopolitan
