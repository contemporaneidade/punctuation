By looking at three ethnographic cases  the author explores discrepancies between French notions of paternity and maternity in their legal and ideological aspects  between fathering and mothering in their moral and affective dimensions and between different aspects of caring in the cases of dependent children and of aging parents  The author analyzes these discrepancies from the triple point of view of legal responsibility  who should pay  economic transactions  who gives and receives unpaid and paid care  and of moral feeling  feelings of natural linkage  sense of duty  elective love and quotidian  constructed feeling  She uses the concepts of households of care and lines of transmission to show how the economic and affective dimensions of kinship are connected  trying to understand why French social policies have recently invented a salaried status for caring daughters  but none for caring mothers
