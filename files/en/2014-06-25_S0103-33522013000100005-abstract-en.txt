Since the 1990s the deliberative ideal has come to play a central role in contemporary democratic theory  More recently  however  another trend has emerged  deliberative democracy has ceased to be a purely theoretical approach to become the regulatory ideal of concrete institutional solutions  As a result of this shift  the main problems facing deliberative democracy today are  on the one hand  those of its institutionalisation  and  on the other hand  those of its articulation with other democratic mechanisms of a non deliberative nature  As to the first of these problems  this article critically addresses the way in which deliberative democracy has been institutionalized  discussing the perils of depoliticization and of dissolution of the emancipatory potential of deliberative democracy that such an institutionalisation might entail  As to the relationship between deliberation and other democratic mechanisms such as negotiation or aggregation of individual preferences  in opposition to which deliberative democracy had originally been defined  we argue that the future of deliberative democracy depends on renouncing that original antagonism  Instead  deliberation should engage in a complementary relationship   albeit not passive  but active   with these other essential constitutive elements of democratic political life
