This paper aims to examine how political conversations take place on the online forum offered as part of the Digital Participatory Budget  OPD  in a Brazilian city  Belo Horizonte  The authors propose an analytical model based on deliberative theories in order to investigate the discussions over this participatory program  The main sample consists of the messages posted by the users  n 357  on the commentaries section  The results show that reciprocity and reflexivity among interlocutors are rare  however  the respect among the interlocutors and the justification levels in several arguments were high during the discussion  The authors conclude that  even in a situation in which there is no empowerment offered by of the digital tools  the internet can effectively provide environments to enhance a qualified discursive exchange  In spite of low levels of deliberativeness  the case study shows that there are important gains concerning social learning among the participants
