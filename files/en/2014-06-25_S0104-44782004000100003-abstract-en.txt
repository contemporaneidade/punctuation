This articles discusses the false convergence between the role of the media in promoting democracy and political theories of democracy  With this purpose in mind  we propose critical reflections on arguments that  1  naturalize the fact that  the news  is a commodity  b  focus on the  supposedly  public goals of the media  in spite of the reality that their agencies are largely private  c  link these agencies to liberal  democratic values  Thus  the text attempts to show both the absence of and need for shields   personified in the theories of weights and counterbalances   against the powers that be  particularly those of the media  We point to the paradox involved in the media s role as intermediary between public and private spheres and question the degree to which the media permit fulfillment of the idea that those have control should be controlled  particularly in a world in which communication has extended its action to the planetary level  We conclude that democracy can only be made effective if democratic controls over the media are exercised  this makes the creation of national and international level public information media that would be neither privately nor state owned and managed
