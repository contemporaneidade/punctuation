Human rights of older adults are still not sufficiently developed  The  older adults  are still perceived as homogeneous social group within legal framework  which leaves room for multiple discrimination  However  the experience of the old age is different and it depends on race  class  gender  occupation  place of living  and so forth  This paper will explore how the rights of older adults are regulated within European law  Ageing in Europe is accelerating and puts pressure on welfare systems  That is why both the retirement system and the perception of older adults should be revised  In dealing with the problem of discrimination against older adults  this paper will inquire whether citizenship which transcends any idea of age represents a symbolic and normative imperative of Europe today
