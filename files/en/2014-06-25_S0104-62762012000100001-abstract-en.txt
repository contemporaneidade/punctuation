This article has two main objectives  The first one is to create a profile of Senators  substitutes  compared to the elected Senators  The second objective is to investigate the substitutes  political performance  with the intent of evaluating the impact of their actions on both the functioning of the Senate and their relationship to the Executive Power  We suggest that  because they are not directly elected  they are selected to work on difficult tasks  especially those that could bring negative political effects to the Senators  which depend on the electorate s vote  We also found that the substitutes give a bit more support to the Presidency  particularly observed in right wing parties coalitions
