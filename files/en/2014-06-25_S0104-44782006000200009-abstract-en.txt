The goal of this paper is to relate debates on foreign policy and public policy through a constitutional perspective  To free ourselves from the consensus that exists around the notion that foreign policy has always been considered  foreign  to states and distinct from any and all domestic policy   and thus  from any and all public policy   we have sought to identify domestic  foreign and international policy as a continuum within the same decision making processes  On the basis of these theoretical premisses  we have then presented an analysis of the distribution of Brazilian foreign policy capacities within the 1967 and 1988 Constitutions  in order to identify   within the context of Brazilian re democratization   possible changes in regulating foreign policy that could suggest a conception of polyarchic management bringing it closer to other forms of public policy  Lastly  we compare the mechanisms provided by the 1988 Constitutions for the control of foreign policy and public policy in general  in order to bring them closer and to verify the applicability of public policy mechanisms to the control of foreign policy
