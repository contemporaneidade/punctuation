The present article utilizes the constructivist approach of International Relations  IR  to analyze the international normative impact of the Bhopal chemical accident  focusing on the constitutive role of the human action on the International Environmental Politics  IEP  It adopts an articulation of constructivist concepts  useful to visualize the structure in which the local event is embedded  as well as the social construction process of either the event and the international norm launched  The assumption is that a co constitution relation between structure and agents  who are responsible for the social construction of the event  is preponderant and that  consequently  it is impossible to exclude these elements or their connecting links from the analysis  The article aims at understanding  on the one hand  the way in which the event is socially constructed  referring to the ideational and normative structure of environmental protection and sustainable development  and  on the other  how the local event produces political  social and normative impact at international level  As a result  the global features of local events become evident  specially considering the ideational and normative fulfillment of an environment consciousness  whose political milestones are the Stockholm 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  held in Rio de Janeiro  Therefore  the article emphasizes the cultural and institutional environmental context as whole  pointing out the local global relationship  It also focuses on the role of the International Labour Organization  ILO  as a leader agency in the chemical safety field  in an attempt to indicate why the normative construction process has taken place on the forum of that International Organization  IO
