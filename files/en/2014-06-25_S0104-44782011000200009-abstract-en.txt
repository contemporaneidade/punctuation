This article provides a general presentation of the research methodology of prosopography  In the first place  it supplies a historical review of the first real prosopographic efforts  distinguishing the elitist schools  of a more individualizing nature  from the sociological ones  which are more collectivist in their approach  This is followed by a discussion of the precursors of the method and some of the most important early works  Charles Beard and Lewis Namier s historiographic research and Robert Merton s work in Sociology  We then comment on some of the major problems involved in acritical use of prosopography  the absence of adequate data  mistakes in data classification  errors in data interpretation and problems in the theoretical interpretation of data  The identification of these problems is not intended to negate prosopography s importance but to clarify the dangers inherent to its careless usage  Thus  we go on to discuss some of the most important results in contemporary prosopography  taking English research as our reference  Finally  we comment on the general frame of contemporary prosopographic studies  indicating the situation that prevails in the United States and France  as well as possibilities and risks that the introduction of the computer brings to historiographic practice
