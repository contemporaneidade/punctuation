This paper discusses the fabrication of persons and things through legal techniques  taking as reference a study of Brazilian court rulings involving human beings after death  Analysis of these decisions reveals that any categorization of an entity as a person or thing depends on contingent distinctions made in particular situations  which in turn implies that law is in fact a powerful ontological device creating the world to which it refers  The contextuality of the person thing distinction  partly associated with the complex topography of legal branches and specialities  allows different degrees of personification and reification to be identified  along with the possibility of fabricating persons and things by combining specific attributes from different entities
