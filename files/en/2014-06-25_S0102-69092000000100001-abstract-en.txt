The aim of the conference was to present an interpretation of the vicissitudes of the ethnical and or national identity when observed in ambiguous situations  This is when the identity process expresses real or virtual crisis  such as the case of Latin American immigrants in the United States  or the people from different Spanish regions who emigrated to Barcelona  Spanish Catalans with French and Andorrans living in Andorra  and among the Indigenous people on the Brazilian borders with neighboring countries  The examination of the identity process that takes place in different latitudes  in the Americas and Europe  suggests that socio cultural phenomena of ethnicity and nationality have common characteristics such as the search for recognition of the moral person  the respect to difference  and as an ethnical corollary  the rise of what it could be defined as an index of consideration
