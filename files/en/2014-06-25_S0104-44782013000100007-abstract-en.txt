In their most recent book  Rule of Law Reform and Development  Charting the Fragile Path of Progress  Michael Trebilcock and Ron Daniels show how rule of law reforms have a mixed   not to say disappointing   track record of successes  Their diagnosis is that social   historical   cultural factors and resistance from interest groups are two of the main obstacles to reform  This essay explores these two obstacles in greater depth  With respect to social   historical   cultural factors  my main argu  ment is that early rule of law reforms can create values  practices  and attitudes that may become impediments to future reforms  On the political economy front  these early reforms can strengthen interest groups that will block future reforms  As a consequence  policy makers face a paradox  robust rule of law reforms early on may undermine broader reform efforts by reducing the possibility of other necessary reforms down the road  creating a reform trap  I illustrate the paradox with a Brazilian case study and discuss possible strategies to address this challenge
