Ideal and reality of the criminal justice system  Rio de Janeiro  a city without racism  It is to be understood why the media  and even scholars  can manage to speak and write about the peculiar violence of Rio de Janeiro and its  favelas   slums  making no point of the desproportionate visibility of black people as perpetrators or victims  The article claims that racism plays an important role in the process  and that  probably due to the taken for granted assumption that Brazil is a racial democracy  public officers may discriminate black people withou even suspecting that they are doing so  The analysis is based on the different views of the problem  as perceived by  middle class  people on the one hand and by  poor  people on the other  and also on actual cases of racism taken to the criminal justice system  Concerning the  strategies of police intervention  it seems clear  accounting for our distinctive hierarchical society  that any action should go far beyond the vicious circle of  organizational measures  as is normally assumed to be the solution  and should respond to needs of a different nature  The starting point might be the militarist misconception of the police role that pervades law enforcement in Brazil  to the detriment of most of the Population  specially those marked by the colour of their skin  the focus being Rio de Janeiro  Themes like  police in a democracy   community policing   anti discrimination  and the like might be of much help to law enforcement if put at issue with prominence
