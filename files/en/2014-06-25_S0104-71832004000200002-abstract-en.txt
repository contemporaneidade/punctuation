Against a common anachronistic bias in historical readings of XVIIIth news and periodicals  this article tries to build an  horizon of expectation   Hans Robert Jauss  of well informed readers of the Lisbon gazette  Gazeta de Lisboa  published between 1715 and 1760  As a case study  I analyse the way the gazette refrained from speaking of the diplomatic conflicts in which Portugal was then involved  Under a surface of apparent silence  though  manuscript journals and periodicals show us to which extent reading of the printed newspaper is more complex than we may expect  In the second part of the article  I try to describe the relationship between printed and handwritten news as a coherent system of communication  based on political  social and technical differences  I argue that  more than of opposition  we should speak of complementary roles of these two media
