This article examines the conditions under which environmental activism emerged and evolved in Brazil from 1970 e 2006  The idea was to introduce a conceptual discussion on the relations between  opportunity structures   political processes  and  individual involvement  in the emergence of mobilizations and collective protests  The methodology consisted of biographical interviews with three different generations of activists  focusing on the meanings associated with the use of academic training in activism  the principal modalities of militant careers  and the types of resources and social ties that support the activists  concepts and practices  The research showed that the period under study constitutes a milestone for the emergence of new patterns for reconverting university and professional training into militant resources for action in the  environmental field
