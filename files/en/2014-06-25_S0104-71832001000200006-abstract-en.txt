This article aims to analyze the practice and meanings that permeate pirarucu fishing in rural communities of the Lower Amazon  State of Par  Brazil  The pirarucu  Arapaima gigas  is the largest scale fish of Amazonia and is also an important market product  due mainly to its privileged role in the regional cuisine  Pirarucu fishing is one of the earliest human activities of the Lower Amazon  dating back to pre colonial times  For many fishermen who live on Ituqui Island  catching a pirarucu represents more than a economic security  but also a set of meanings and experiences ontologically structured in their everyday life and identity  Social conflict and personal disputes are intensified or lightened  and old affections and social ties are reinforced through the practices and encounters experienced during a fishing trip to one of the nearby lakes  Beyond the practice per se  these fishing trips trigger mnemonic and affective references to the landscape and the momentum of capture  and the sense of place  resulting in a processual unity intimately connected to personal and social meanings that cannot be compartmentalized  In the midst of so many motivations behind pirarucu fishing  aggressive disputes and irrational captures may take place  Fishing spots are kept secret and territorial bonds are protected  Rights to this resource and  by extension  over the meanings and emotions to which it is connected becomes  to a certain extend  a luxury aggressively protected by some  The decrease of the pirarucu stocks  new fishing technologies and the great demand and  mystique  still surrounding its capture have posed a dilemma to the fishermen  the survival of the pirarucu  fishing  collides with what the environmentalists have called the rationality of conservation
