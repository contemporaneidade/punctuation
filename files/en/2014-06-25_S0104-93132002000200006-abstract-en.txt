This article proceeds from the hypothesis that a plurality of social scenes exist in which individuals interact and individual actions acquire meaning  Each social scene corresponds to different practical rationalities  Examining the practices involved in measuring and counting allows us to distinguish these scenes and comprehend how they are mutually interconnected  As a demonstration of the diversity of native reasoning  the article first turns to the wide variety of units of measurement used by amateur horticulturists  Next  it examines the ritual settings of various transactions and shows that the rational consumer  shy  in the sense expounded by utilitarian theory  shy  need not rely on any explicit calculation  since the ascetic ethos can be found inscribed in body routines  In conclusion  the article calls for a systematic study of economic socialization and outlines three leads for such research  description of the diversity of social scenes  analysis of the ritual settings of transactions  and study of the perceptions of constraints and the practices of self control among the various social classes  The author suggests such an approach may enable us to define domains of validity for the mathematical formalizations of human behaviours developed by economists
