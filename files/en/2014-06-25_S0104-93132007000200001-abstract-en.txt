The last thirty years have seen a remarkable growth in the ethnomusicology of the South American lowlands  The region has emerged from relative obscurity   a state in which it languished for decades  despite possessing some of the world s oldest descriptions of  primitive  music   through the publication of a wide variety of texts on the musical production of its indigenous peoples  along with various attempts at regional and sub regional comparison  This ethnomusicological output   much of it originating in Brazil from the early 1990s onwards   has been complimented by monographs and regional comparative studies from anthropologists specialized in other areas  whose work has frequently highlighted the importance of music  typically in connection with other art forms  cosmology  shamanism and philosophy  for a clearer understanding of the region  The resulting panorama is promising  However it also requires analysis  a fundamental element in determining paths for future research  Divided into two parts  the article approaches this endeavour by focusing on written production  making secondary use of phonographic  videographic and other documental forms  The first part of the text surveys the literature produced on the region s music over the period  In the second part  I reflect on the main features of indigenous music to emerge from the literature and propose a number of working hypotheses for future investigations
