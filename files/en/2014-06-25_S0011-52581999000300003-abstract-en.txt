In an examination of Hayek s social philosophy  the article seeks to distinguish between socio epistemological arguments  which postulate the radical ignorance of social actors  and the conservative political conclusions usually associated with Hayek s thought  which prophesy the destruction of the spontaneous order owing to efforts to intervene in the social world  The ultimate purpose of drawing this distinction is to lay the ground for a discussion of a new alliance  one between these arguments and the possibility of design  This exploration of multi sided Hayekian argumentation allows us to identify some ambiguities essential towards the article s purposes  The most important ambiguity appears in the argument against planned changes  where Hayek describes the foreseeable negative consequences of such changes and also sketches the scenario shaped by the foreseeable beneficial effects of the undisturbed operation of the spontaneous order
