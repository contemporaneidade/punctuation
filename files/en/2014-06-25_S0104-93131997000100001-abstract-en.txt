This article is intended to delineate the place occupied by studies on the globalization of the history of anthropological ideas  based on the premise that cultural interconnections have never been absent from the concerns of anthropology  even when dealt with under the most widely diverse conceptual models  This objective is the basis for an investigation of the genealogy of the vocabulary used by transnational anthropology  unveiling the meanings and uses of three key words   flows  frontiers  and hybrids   both within anthropology and in a broader interdisciplinary context  By establishing multiple dialogues   with diffusionists  theorists of acculturation  and contemporary multiculturalist currents  amongst others  the text points to the reflexive dimension that the problematic  yet enriching  relationship between academic and native concepts has impressed on anthropology  especially through studies on globalization
