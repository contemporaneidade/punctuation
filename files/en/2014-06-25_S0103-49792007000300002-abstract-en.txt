In this paper  we seek to define the globalization from the identification of a series of social mechanisms through which it acts directly on the individual and collective behaviors or  still  on the way of thinking  on faiths  on identities  on the forms of institutionalization  etc  What constitutes the specificity of globalization is exactly the fact of its being a social phenomenon shons in the whole planet  Will the specific mechanisms characterizing the operation of the globalization be applicable in the same conditions in the societies that present strong differences  like North and South societies  Different mechanisms  linked to the reinforcement of international econo mical competition and its consequences on the system of social protection  or  still  linked to the diffusion of norms and of political practices in the context of globalization  will be approached afterwards  In a more systematic way  four scenarios convergence  divergence  hybridization and recomposition of the international hierarchies will be pre sented in the context of a comparative analysis of the effects of globalization in North and South
