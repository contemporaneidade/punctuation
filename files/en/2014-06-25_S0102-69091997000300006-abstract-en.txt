The article analyses the characteristics of the decision making process of tax reforms  At the empirical level  it focuses on the patterns of political interaction among political actors with specific reference to recent reforms in Brazil  The reform arena is described as exhibiting great technical complexity and medium political salience  and involving basically bureaucratic elites and state governors  The author concludes that the recent deadlock in tax reform can be explained by the consociational elements of the Brazilian political system  by the  political geometry of reform losses  and by collective action problems encountered by state governors  It is further argued that governors face a  prisoner s dilemma  type of incentive structure
