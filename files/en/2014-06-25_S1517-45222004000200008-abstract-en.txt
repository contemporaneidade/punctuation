This work is aimed at debating the meaning of granted autonomy as the organizational corollary of a subjective mobilization demand  Labor in undergoing the contradiction between the eulogy to autonomy and an increasing normalized labor organization  where being autonomous is the rule  The concept of labor autonomy resorts to two issues  the operational dimension and the identity dimension  The transformation of labor into a good whose possession demands sacrifices and the transformation of the job into a privilege culminate at subjection of the worker s very person  without really raising the issue of labor re appropriation  which a priori follows labor autonomy  The core issue  however  cannot be diluted into this paradox between real autonomy and granted autonomy  the search for autonomy is placed out of the economic logic and within a logic of values and achievement of meaning  while granted autonomy is part of an instrumental logic
