The process of making decisions and implementing environmental policies tends to adopt internationally accepted criteria as requisites of viability and sufficiency to attain aimed ends  It is as if there was a handbook of general rules for the attainment of sustainable development  Currently there is a kind of a  virtual   good governance manual  or  handbook  wich serves as a guide and a requisite for the drafting of socioenviromental programs and projects  However  the indiscriminate reproduction and the endless expansion of the list of requirements may have an effect that is contrary to what is expected of them  helping to create obstacles to the efficient implementation of environmental and development policies  The concern about the formal compliance with general criteria may hinder their substantive expression  This allows space for free riders of the environmental discourse and for the creation of a void between discourse and practice in the field of environmental management  This article examines how these requisites for good governance are produced and reproduced  The dynamics of this process  governed by the aformentioned handbook  help make those requisites trite and volatile  If sustainability is transformed into a trite matter  there is a growing distance between the politically correct discourse and the practical effectiveness of environmental and developmental policies  In order to reduce this distance  this text proposes the use of the concept of sufficiently good governance  This concept may represent an alternative to the failings of the handbook  as it helps focus on the essential aspects and separate the intended from the possible and from the indispensable
