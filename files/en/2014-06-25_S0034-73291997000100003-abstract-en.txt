This paper aims to be a reflection on the importance of the Brazil and Argentina closer relations in the nuclear field  in the late eighties and early nineties  as the basis for building a new relationship that replaced a historical rivalry  The aproximation process has begun with apparently economic purposes  but also had a strategic dimension  The repercussions of this effort went beyond immediate bilateral interests  reflected in the search for a new international insertion by both countries  at a time of deep transformations  both internally and internationally  The Brazil Argentina integration program  that later also involved Uruguay  and MERCOSUL led to the establishment of a political legal structure that created a reality that goes beyond economics to the political domain
