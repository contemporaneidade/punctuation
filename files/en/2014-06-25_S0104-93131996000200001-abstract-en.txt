Resuming an analysis of the gift  this article seeks to go beyond the phenomenological  structuralist  and economicist view of this phenomenon  It thereby shifts the trust of questioning towards the time and uncertainty linked with the interval between the gift and the counter gift  the agent and the action linked to such practices  the economy of symbolic goods  and the specific habitus underlying it  It thus demonstrates against any and all reductionism  to consciousness  to unconcious calculation  and to calculation per se  that the gift s reason can only lie in its double truth  its generous and obligatory nature  both disinterested and interested  The author also demonstrates historically that it is only through a symbolic revolution  and not the development of a supposed human nature  that an economy of exchange can stand out from the economy of the gift  whose possibility remains open  requiring collective investments in its direction
