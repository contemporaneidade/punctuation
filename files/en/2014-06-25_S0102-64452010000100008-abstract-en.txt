The article intends to produce a reflection on the problems faced by anthropologists  and professional peers  when it comes to taking the theme of research topics  activities  actions and words that reach deep into our moral system  What to do when we study people considered criminal in our world  What to do when we study key issues such as science  democracy  justice  human rights  With the help of an ethnographic circumstance in which representatives of electoral justice clash with habitual users of representative democracy  I tried to show the difficulties of understanding these two sets and the complexity of the situation in which two parties enter into a communication without fully understanding the other language  Both  however  seem to feed two trusts  to understanding the language of the speaker and the superiority of their own  The general idea of the article is that this feature ethnographic can make us give up so much of absolutism and moral relativism
