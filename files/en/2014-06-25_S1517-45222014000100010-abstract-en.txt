In this article  we suggest to reflect critically on the trivial usage of the concept of identity in the social sciences  We propose to take it as an ongoing social phenomenon primarily affected by power relations  The article presents a contextualization of the theme in recent decades and draws on ideas of classic authors  It also points out to one of the possible paths for research on identity processes  Then  four elements are emphasized  the actors  the disputes  the standards and the contexts which we believe are the constituents of this social phenomenon  suggesting how to proceed with their analysis
