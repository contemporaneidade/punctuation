The electoral system affects in advance and decisively the nature of representative mandates and the legitimacy of legislative decisions  Majoritarian systems decrease the density of the representative mandate and  when districts are numerically small in terms of both representatives and constituency  such systems tend to curtail the independence of elected officeholders  whose actions can be monitored by the dominant local groups  On the other hand  proportional systems that operate with numerically large districts maximize the density of representative mandates and  at the same time  ensure the elected officeholder the independent responsibility that characterizes the modern representative mandate  There are  however  three varieties of proportional systems  flexible list  open list  and no list  where the vote cast for candidates from different parties or inter party electoral coalitions eliminate the party quota and jeopardize party identity both inside and outside the legislative realm  In the Brazilian case  this mechanism follows and reinforces the individualistic and atomistic tradition of the political elites
