Looking at one of the World Bank s current objectives   the  struggle against poverty    this paper seeks to contextualize the moment in which the the category  poverty  enters the prescriptions of that institution  This involves the analysis of some of its reports on that topic  followed by an analysis of the significance of the use of the concept in the elaboration of social policies for  developing  countries  We suggest that the use of the concept  poverty  makes reference to a clearly defined theoretical framework linked to neoliberalism  By prioritizing  the poor  as the target of its policies  it performs a dislocation of social policy from the universal notion of  right  and  in the last analysis  suggests the supression of the idea and the reality of social citizenship
