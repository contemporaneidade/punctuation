This article examines the debate on native Amazonian infanticide triggered by the lobbying of the NGO ATINI Voice for Life in both cyberspace and the Brazilian media  It argues that this debate has been carried out in Western terms  the supposed isomorphism between the notions of  humanness  and  personhood  and  as such  contributes little to understanding this unusual indigenous practice  To avoid the dual peril of  cultural imperialism  and  cultural relativism  the article adopts a native point of view  The article contends that native Amazonians consider humanness and personhood as independent  states of being  It explores this perception through the analysis of a series of ethnographic  snapshots  in the light of recent theoretical developments  The author concludes that rather than confirming the  primitiveness  of native Amazonian societies  this debate exposes the fracture of the Western notion of  human person  as well as the profound  but potentially positive  crisis of  modern  Western thought
