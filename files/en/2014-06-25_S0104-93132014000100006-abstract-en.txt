This article delimits the concept of ecological epistemologies  which is taken to be a comprehensive posture based on the recognition of the alterity and agency of natural processes  objects and materials  Contemporary authors from different academic trajectories have carried out reflections in this vein and they suggest the emergence of a new realism or a new materialism  It is within this movement that we seek to situate the concept of ecological epistemologies  The adjective  ecological  seems plausible  insofar as it repositions the human in a network of symmetrical  and reciprocally determined  relations  In this way  the ecological epistemologies give voice to the world  considering the autonomy of things and of nature in their relations with humans  without thereby falling into the traps of cultural or biological determinisms  This article contextualizes the interface of the new materialisms and the environmental field  as this emerges from anthropology  philosophy  and science studies  This seems to us to be a fruitful avenue for understanding our place in the world and the world s place in us from an ecological perspective  in the sense of an ecology of though  action and knowledge
