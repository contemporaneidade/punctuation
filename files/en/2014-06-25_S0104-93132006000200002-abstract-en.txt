This article discusses the differences and relations between witchcraft and shamanism among the Wauja Indians of the Upper Xingu river  focusing on the processes of body transformations  notions of lethal agency and the ontology of predation  Witchcraft is described as an accusation category referencing murder and also as an anti power apparatus in the context of strong and relatively authoritarian chieftainships  Accusations  especially those of murder  weave a political plot that brings witchcraft to the center of Wauja sociality  Our main hypothesis is that witchcraft has a double political effect  simultaneous or successive  in the Wauja sociological landscape  it can serve to persecute  eliminate  or exile a chief s adversaries  but it also may turn against a chief  compromising his prestige and contesting his status  Witchcraft also has a double aesthetic effect  it is the most perfect incarnation of ugliness and of sadness death and is thus opposed to ritual and to the very materials of the therapeutic projects that characterize Xinguano shamanism
