By focusing on lawsuits in which the long established categorization of animals as things is at stake  this paper aims to attain a better understanding of the legal fabrication of persons and things  and the role that science lately plays in this context  The first case is an application for habeas corpus on behalf of two female chimpanzees  The scope of the second one is the acknowledgement of a male chimpanzee as a  human  person  It is argued that one corollary of the legal opposition person thing is the homogenization of difference  Therefore  the problem involved in the recognition of animals as subjects of rights seems to be how to conceptually fabricate   and thereby bring into existence   another difference  i e  a difference that does not fit in the traditional modes of legal differentiation
