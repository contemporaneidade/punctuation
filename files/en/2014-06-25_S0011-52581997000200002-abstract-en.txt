The article contends that for Tocqueville the notion of Providence was an important tool in dealing with problems he encountered both in explaining the emergence of democratic equality as a universal phenomenon and in defining possible lines of action for those who  like him  advocated a liberal solution to the challenges brought by modernity  Specifically  it is argued that the notion of Providence played three roles in the construction of Tocqueville s arguments  a rhetorical role  convincing his peers that a return to the Old Regime was unfeasible  a cognitive role  lending meaning to the long term process without reinforcing materialist views regarding either chance or the causality immanent to history  and an ethical political role  determining the role of responsible human action within the contemporary world
