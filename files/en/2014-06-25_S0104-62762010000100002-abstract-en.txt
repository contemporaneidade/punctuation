Abstract  The article tests at the individual level and for a group of four Latinamerican countries the hypothesis proposed by the defenders of the theory of the human development about the association between postmaterialist values and a participative posture  Using data from the World Values Survey we verify the validity of this in that measured that statement in the context of nations with economics and materials problems and characterized as young democracies  Using techniques of bivariate and multivariate analysis we verifyed that among publics of those countries the participation is more influenced by variables related to the citizens  social centrality than by changes in their value s priorities  what leads to the conclusion that the explanatory model suggested by Inglehart is problematic to Latinamerica contexts and should be criticized
