This study analyzes a sector of Argentine thought from the 1930s  represented in the essays on the national  soul  or character  This essay writing produced a number of texts that were transformed  through critical appraisal  into classics on the country itself   such as Radiograf a de la pampa by Ezequiel Mart nez Estrada  and Historia de una pasi n argentina by Eduardo Mallea   and which emerged out of a political crisis   whose first notable effect was the 1930 coup d tat   and a more widespread disruption of the intellectual points of reference caused by the exhaustion of positivism as a paradigm among the cultural elites  The unease provoked by the national political context merged with the unease stemming from European thought concerning the crisis   the crisis of spirit  of the liberal order and of capitalism   and this amalgam fed a state of intellectual discontent that took concrete form in the essay  In an ever broader way  this genre stimulated a profound revision of liberal Argentina  Among the texts involved in this process we can highlight the essays by Mart nez Estrada and Mallea  analyzed in the final part of the study
