European citizenship is marked by a tension  between a citizenship that is derivative of the nation state and a citizenship that is defined by free movement  Approaching this tension as symptomatic of a deep rooted contradiction between integration and mobility that is constitutive of modern social formations  this article develops a political sociology of mobility that challenges territorial and culturalist accounts of European citizenship  It does so by exploring the political enactment of European citizenship by marginalized subjects  whose engagement in relations of exchange serve as the ground for acts of European citizenship that  mobilize mobility  This is illustrated by an analysis of the 2005 Declaration for the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe
