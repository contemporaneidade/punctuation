In recent times  efforts have been made to bring two approaches previously considered to be antagonic and impossible to reconcile closer  This refers to an attempt to intermediate views that  on the one hand  emphasize the importance of individuals  strategic choices and  on the other  prioritize the historical importance of socio historical norms and institutions in political and social results  The present article takes part in this debate and within this context  the question  Does culture matter  comes to the forefront  Taking this question as our point of departure  we seek an empirical analysis of the statistical relevance of a specific cultural value   social capital  and its significance for the quality of democracy  The efforts we carry out consist in attempt to empirically clarifying whether social capital  understood here through indicators of interpersonal trust  trust in institutions and political trust  is related to the quality of democracy  measured here through two indicators  Freedom House and The Economic Inteligence Unit  We conclude that  if relying exclusively on the concept of interpersonal trust as a measure of social capital  we will not be able to consider the latter as a cultural value that is relevant for democracy  With regard to trust in institutions  this factor s negative correlation to degrees of democratization in the countries studied demonstrates quite clearly that the circle of virtue suggested by Robert Putnam cannot be confirmed  Erosion of trust in governments  within democratic regimes  is strong evidence that there is no positive  virtuous association between confidence  civic culture or any other denomination that has been suggested in the attempt to build causal links between social capital and democracy  Yet notwithstanding negative results and the limitations that we have pointed to in relation to the scope of the theory of social capital  our text is revealing of a debate that is currently under construction and seems to hold promise
