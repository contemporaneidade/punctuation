This article revisits the founding moment of Brazilian political institutions in order to highlight the penetration of French monarchical discourse among statesmen connected to the Brazilian Crown  The concept of a moderating power was thus mobilized strategically by these statesmen to safeguard the Crown s prerogatives from the growing interference of the 1823 Constitutional Congress  The objective was to justify the preeminence of the Prince over Parliament as representative of the nation s sovereignty  This justification introduced new semantic meanings into the concept  such as those of active neutrality  discretionarity  and centralization  which came to be identified with the state itself during the state building process  The result was that the legal text allowed a monarchical reading of the Chief of State as an axis for government activity  but also another  ultraliberal reading in which he appeared merely as arbiter of the Constitutional system
