The article pursues a comparison between Andr  Gorz and some of the most important authors from the new economic sociology  True enough  this dialogue never took explicit form  What makes the comparison relevant  though  is that it enables the exposition of two alternative ways of approaching the basic sociological theme of the insertion of markets in social life  For Gorz  market and civil society are antinomic terms and there is no more important political task than to prevent the invasion and colonization of social life and affective relations by the marketplace  For economic sociology  by contrast  markets are completely immersed in and explained by social life  and cannot be considered as autonomous institutional spheres  This difference in the way of conceiving the relationship between economy and society has fundamental political consequences  for Gorz  the social networks involved in the expansion of free software potentially represent the beginning of a non capitalist society  For the new economic sociology  networks based on non commercial relations can be encountered in the market itself  In addition  the social insertion of markets encourages political action to be directed not only towards the public and associative sector  but also increasingly the organization of the private sector itself
