This article interrogates assumptions about the on line off line distinction in internet research  Much research has presumed  virtuality  and a strong division between the on line and the off line as a methodological and analytical given and starting point for research  We argue that when actual internet use is approached from an ethnographic perspective  this distinction turns out to be a highly contingent social accomplishment  some actors deploy great skill to establish a sharp on line off line distinction in their internet practices  for others  it is meaningless or undesirable and the distinctions is not established in reality  A comparison of cybercafes in Trinidad is used to demonstrate this variability and the wide range of different on line off line relationships that are in fact observed  We relate this material to the overall issue of establishing  contexts  in ethnographic research
