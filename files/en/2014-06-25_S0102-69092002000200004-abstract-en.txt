Notwithstanding all other possible links between Republic and Democracy  the intent of this article is to point out a conceptual gap between the combinations of normative ideals related to those two institutional arrangements  therefore highlighting the difficulties of making them interchangeable terms  Apart from a few exceptions  two of them being subject of our analysis here  the authors who try to rescue the Republican tradition of political thought pay almost no attention to those difficulties  assuming immediately the continuity from what they call  Democracy  to what they call  Republic  This requires a critical examination in order to better access how the typical topics of the classical Republicanism can still help us to illuminate  and even innovate  the contemporary democratic thought and experience
