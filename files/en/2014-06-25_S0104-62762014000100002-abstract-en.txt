One of the main themes in democratic theory is the process through which citizens control the activity of its representatives  In this paper we analyze the Brazilian political system in general terms and the 1998 and 2006 election in particular in order to argue that the processes of vertical accountability in the electoral gaps empower citizens in the sense of punishing and rewarding their representatives in the electoral moment  The importance of this work is guaranteed by the political context experienced by the country in the last couple of years before the 2006 election  A significant number of politicians had been involved in corruption scandals that resounded in the Brazilian society in a very negative way  Despite of the costs of information  limited time to be concerned with politics  and the huge social inequality allied to poverty  we show that voters have been able to punish those that had been involved in scandals
