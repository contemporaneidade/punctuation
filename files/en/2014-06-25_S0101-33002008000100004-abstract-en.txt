It has become a commonplace that Rio de Janeiro s guerra do tr fico is entirely unique within Brazil  In fact  this is inaccurate  Drug trafficking organizations that in many respects resemble Rio s fac es do exist in other urban contexts  What differentiates them is less the ability to establish a local monopoly on the drug trade than the resilience of their internal structure  and consequently the duration of their existence and domination  During field research in nine peripheral communities in three cities  I observed not only high variation in the degree of concentration between local drug markets  but also variation over time within single communities  In this light  the stability of Rio s highly concentrated drug market can be seen as a unique equilibrium in which the fragmentary forces at work in other cities are neutralized by specific traits of Rio s factions  These traits  I argue  stem from the dominion these factions have exerted over the state s prison system since before the period of their original expansion into the drug trade
