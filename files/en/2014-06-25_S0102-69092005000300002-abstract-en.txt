I review the main concepts of Max Weber s Sociology of religion to reaffirm their sheer importance to understand religious phenomena  both in their own dynamics and in their links with other dimensions of social life  Then I turn myself to the task of follow up in a critical vein some of the readings of Weber done by contemporary sociologists in France  Pierre Bourdieu  in the United States  Peter Berger  and in Brazil  Flavio Pierucci  Though arriving at controversial results  they are fine attempts to supersede Weber s work but keep this though alive  In the final part of the article  I change criticism into proposition trying to understand the scope of processes of world disenchantment and secularization in the Brazilian context
