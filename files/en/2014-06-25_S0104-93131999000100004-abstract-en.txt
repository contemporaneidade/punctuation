The article states the high evaluation that an Amazonian people  the Piaroa  place upon the artful skills of everyday existence  It is argued that their emphasis upon the creativity of daily practice is forthcoming from a powerful and egalitarian social philosophy  The difficulties of translating such a philosophy  where the human self are contextualised within a wider cosmic setting  is raised  The aim of translation would be to enable us to engage in dialogue with the Piaroa about common concerns  upon the relation of the individual to the collectivity  for instance  or upon the idea of freedom  or the question of the relation of customs to rational decision making  These are a people who overtly shun the idea of a social rule  yet strongly value sociality  their own customs  and the mutuality of the ties of community  They at the same time demonstrate even more forcefully an  obstinate individualism  A major puzzle to be discussed is the notion that personal autonomy is understood as a social capacity  and a cultural one as well  the volitional I  the social relation  and the cultural artifice are an associated set of values  The centrality of the notions of reflective reason and personal trust to this particular egalitarian ethics will be discussed
