The history of independent Brazil may be divided in three major political cycles  and  since 1930  we can distinguish five political pacts or class coalitions  Since 1930 these pacts have been nationalist  Only in the 1990s the Brazilian elites surrendered to the neoliberal hegemony  Yet  since the mid 2000s  they are recovering their idea of nation  In fact  the main claim of the essay is that Brazilian elites and the Brazilian society are  national dependent  i  e    they are ambiguous and contradictory  requiring an oxymoron to define them  Today  it searches for a synthesis between the two last political cycles   between social justice and economic development in the framework of democracy
