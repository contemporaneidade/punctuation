This article compares campaign revenue of female and male candidates to the positions of Federal and State Deputies in the elections of 2006  in Brazil  Based on analysis of disaggregated statistical data by sex  provided by the Superior Electoral Tribunal  it was considered if women and men raise different amounts of campaign revenue  and the extent to which this might constitute an explaining factor for women s low electoral performance  Data provide evidence that women have campaign revenues significantly smaller than men and that given the existing high correlation between campaign finance and electoral success  this may constitute a central element in explaining their low performance in elections
