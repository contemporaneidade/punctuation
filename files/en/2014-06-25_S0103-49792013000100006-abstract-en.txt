This article defends the thesis that the capitalist crisis and the ecological crisis are both the result of the dynamics of the capitalist system which transforms human beings and natural resources into goods which are necessary for the expansion of business and the accumulation of profits  The current crisis reflects the difficulties of industrial capitalist civilization and its lifestyle  known as the American way of life  to keep from falling apart  The ecological issue  the environment  is central to capitalism  Attempted solutions  such as the Kyoto Protocol and the environmental agreements made in Copenhagen in 2008  fall far short of the steps needed to solve the problem  Eco socialism  with its utopian nature  unless it becomes an abstraction  offers itself as a paradigm of alternative civilization
