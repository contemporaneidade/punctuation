The recent book by Mariano Plotkin about the  psychoanalytical culture  in Argentina brings forth ample discussions about the role of psychoanalysis in the dynamics of different national societies within the scope of modern Western culture  The comparison between Argentina and Brazil is particularly rich  as also in the latter a significant diffusion of psychoanalysis took place during an homologous period  Plotkin presents a very complex and minute analysis of the phenomena in focus  His analysis reveals the main constitutive tensions of Argentine history during the XXth century  approaching the relationships with psychiatry  medicine  psychology  as well as with  Peronism  and lef wing militancy  I emphasize the importance of his demonstration that  psychoanalytical culture  has become a  social language  in Argentine society  as well as the importance of his description of the diffusion of psychoanalysis by mass communication  which led to a wider social range of reception than in Brazil  I also emphasize the analytical relevance of his demonstration of the association between this diffusion and a generalized  scientism  of Argentine society  which is connected to the particular characteristics of that country s cultural  modernization
