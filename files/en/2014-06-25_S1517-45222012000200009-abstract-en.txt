The present article comes up from a reflection upon what lies in the intersection between two premises  a  that science  and in particular  the social sciences  can contribute towards informing both decision making and the formulation of public policies  aiming at improving the welfare of people in the planet  and  b  that the role of agriculture in the conservation of biodiversity is an extremely relevant contemporary issue  hence the need to study it in greater depth  The relationship between agriculture and biodiversity has been subjected to recent questionings  both in society and in the realm of public policies  as a result of growing concerns about the environmental changes caused by anthropic action  However  despite the increase in number of studies on family based agriculture  and on biodiversity in Brazil  the research funding available for researching the relationship between those two broad themes is still incipient  Against this backdrop  we shall pursue two main objectives with this study  1  to investigate how the role of family based agriculture in the preservation of biodiversity has been approached by the Social Sciences in Brazil  particularly in articles published in Brazilian journals during the latter 20 years and available online  2  to test a thorough literature review methodology aimed at helping decision makers involved with public policies and others concerned with this issue
