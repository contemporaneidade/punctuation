This article discusses the topic of domination and counter power using the example of some specific moments of the history of the Candomble  Based on reflections about recent theoretical anthropological and postcolonial perspectives on culture  identity and power  the author tries to show that the Candomble is a disputed terrain not only internally  but also with reference to its outer boundaries  As anthropological perceptions get closer to postcolonial concerns it helps us to get a better understanding of how social agents weave power relations through the articulation of signs and signifiers while promoting acts of identification and delimitation  and how this process contributes to the construction and deconstruction of the scenarios of domination and counter power
