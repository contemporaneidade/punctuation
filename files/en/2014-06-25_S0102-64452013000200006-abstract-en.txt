We discuss in this article the topic of political apathy in our democracy  it does it not from an empirical perspective  but through an analysis of several discourses and theoretical models  which are considered to be  alternately   dominant  or  antagonist  both in academy and in public sphere  The first opposition to be analyzed is that between constitutionalist model and popular sovereignty model  From this analysis  we start the discussion about the social phenomena of judicialization and of indignation among citizens  which stands opposite to the positive activism of those  who are willing to participate directly in decisional processes  including through not institutionalized forms of participation  Finally  we analyze the opposition between technocratic discourse and the idea of a radical democracy  with its vision of a democratic  agonism
