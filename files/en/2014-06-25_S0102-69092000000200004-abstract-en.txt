The objective of the article is to analyze the Brazilian House committee system  using rational choice theories developed originally to analyze the U S  Congress  distributive  informational and majority party  The article starts by noting that despite the preponderance of the Executive over the Legislative agenda  the committees do appear to play an active role in congressional decision making  The existence and functioning of the committees is initially analyzed using the distributive theory  Although this theory did provide some explanation for the working of the committee system in Brazil  this was not deemed sufficient  therefore the paper turned to the informational theory  The Gilligan and Krehbiel model  1997  was adapted to the specificity of the Brazilian Congress  generating hypotheses that are tested using data from the legislatures of 1995 to 1998  The results of a probit analysis on the choice of whether or not to discharge a given committee provide empirical evidence that the committees do in fact have  at least in part  an informational role
