This article presents the results of research on the effects of press coverage of voting in the 2002 and 2006 Brazilian presidential elections of  We argue that it was an important factor in both campaigns  Our dependent variable is made up of a historical series on intention to vote for the major candidates  Lula  Worker s Party or PT  Partido dos Trabalhadores  Serra  Brazilian Social Democratic Party  or PSDB  Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira  Garotinho  Brazilian Socialist Party or PSB  Partido Socialista Brasileiro  and Ciro Gomes  Popular Socialist Party or PPS  Partido Popular Socialista  in 2002  and Lula  Alckmin  PSDB  Helo sa Helena  Party of Socialism and Freedom  or PSOL  Partido Socialismo e Liberdade  and Cristovam Buarque  Democratic Worker s Party  or PDT  Partido Democr tico Trabalhista  in 2006  Our main explanatory variable is electoral coverage in the country s four major daily newspapers  Folha de S  Paulo  O Estado de S  Paulo  O Globo and Jornal do Brasil  The following control variables complete our model  candidates  party propaganda  the free publicly sponsored electoral broadcasting time   known as Hor rio Pol tico Gratuito Eleitoral   in the first and second rounds  presidential debates and presidential popularity rates  Models were estimated through MQO  Test results indicate that in 2002  press coverage given to candidates Lula and Ciro Gomes was one of factors responsible for the variation observed in voting intentions  In 2006  dynamics were a bit more complex  The only the intentions to vote affected by coverage were those for candidate Heloisa Helena  Furthermore  it is surprising that Lula s extremely negative coverage did not cost him votes  Yet this coverage did have an important indirect impact on candidates Alckmin and Cristovam Buarque  Since this impact was larger during the scandal involving PSDB activities  we can assert that press coverage contributed decisively to the need for a second round in the last presidential election  These results are sustained even when applied to analysis of voting patterns for voters with different educational levels  used as a means of controlling for different levels of exposure to newspaper coverage
