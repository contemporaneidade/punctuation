The symbols of the Republic established in Brazil in 1889 do not indicate a radical break with the previous monarchical regime  as was the case in France  The imperial flag s colors refer to those of the Bragan a dynasty  The Republic maintained the flag s structure  but added the motto  Order and Progress  which attested to the fact that the positivists had managed to impose their interpretations upon the new regime  As for the national anthem  the Republic failed to choose a new one and the people manifested their preference for the old imperial anthem  As for the allegory of the Republic  there were attempts to represent it with female figures which were  however  too similar to the French Marianne  The figure of Tiradentes had a resonance that was more durable because it permitted the intercnnection of two primary dimensions of the nation  the abolition of slavery and independence
