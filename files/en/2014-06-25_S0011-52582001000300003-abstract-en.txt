The  third wave of democratization  has produced different experiences and results in countries that have participated in it  In some  redemocratization has meant the drafting of  refounding  constitutions  generating new political and social pacts and commitments  In others  redemocratization has been accompanied by policy making and financial decentralization to sub national governmental levels  In many federal countries  redemocratization  decentralization  and new constitutions have changed the role of federative bodies  In Brazil  all these factors have occurred simultaneously  This article analyzes the decision making process in the National Constituent Assembly vis vis changes in the Federation and the decision to decentralize policy making and financial power to the sub national levels  The  re construction of a federal system focused on the division of political and fiscal power without leading to an imbalance between the federative bodies is an intrinsically contradictory task  thereby generating conflicts and tensions  Based on empirical data  the study seeks to understand a  the paradox of a country with an agenda of problems that require national policies in the decision to decentralize political and financial power and b  the conflicts  alliances  and contradictions generated by the decisions made by members of the Constituent Assembly in relation to the Federation at that specific moment in history
