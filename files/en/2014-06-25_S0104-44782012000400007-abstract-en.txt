My goal here is to return to the premises of Robert Michels  thesis on the organizational dynamics of political parties  marked by two supposedly antagonistic tendencies  the propensity toward the concentration of powers in the hands of an oligarchy  on the one hand  and desires for participation on the part of other party members  on the other  I also look at how scholars of the political party phenomenon tied to contemporary organizational perspectives evaluate Michels  concepts and the prognosis for democracy that emerges from his studies
