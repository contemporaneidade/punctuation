Industrial relations in Brazil have been presenting nowadays a series of innovative negotiations coming from the initiative of collective actors themselves either on the macro social concertation level as well as on labor relations at the plant micro level  These initiatives point to the incorporation and use of a dialogic and comprehensive approach between interlocutors based on the deliberative democracy s analytical body  The limits of such approach in the classical class conflict situations are still to be theoretically stood  This paper aims to make use of that intellectual and academic tool in order to understand practical situations and then testing the accuracy of the tentative use of that tool itself to specific and concrete topics of sociological research  Underlying the paper is the idea that the deliberative procedure on the work s world is a way to enlarge public sphere in Brazil
