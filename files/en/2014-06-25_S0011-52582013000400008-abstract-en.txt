After four administrations  a recent analysis of the work by the Brazilian National Council of Justice concludes that  the glass dome has cracked  since the inertia has been broken and taboos have been challenged  thereby injecting new energy into the judiciary system s leading role through its integration into the public arena  This break developed from an institutional design built under Constitutional Amendment 45 2004  which assigns an external oversight role to the Council  the contours of which have been constructed through its agenda building  the composition of its membership  and the possibilities in its decision making process  These three dimensions help explain the Council s role in the current architecture of the Brazilian judiciary and shed light on the debates over its scope of action
