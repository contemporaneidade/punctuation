This article takes the wild boar hunt as the basis for an ethnographic essay on an indigenous notion of point of view  applied to the field of relations between humans and animals in the cosmology of a Tupi people  the Juruna  In addition to revealing the particular complexity of these relations  the concept of point of view shows how the notion of double is irreducible to that of soul  like  nature and  supernature are effects of perspectives  and finally how the hunt is included in a multiple bilinear spatial temporal structure  evoking the  labyrinths  that the Juruna paint on their skin
