THIS ESSAY proposes a discussion about religion and the State  taking into consideration certain ideals related to Modernity  Inasmuch as laicization is part of these ideals  the focus is on the relationship between religion and the school  Several texts dealing with this relationship  with judicial definitions and with governmental initiatives are analyzed  in an attempt to establish a counterpoint between the situation in France and in Brazil  From France  we examine two reports commissioned by the government   one from the Commission on Laicity  2003  and one on the  teaching of religious facts  in schools  2002  From Brazil  we peruse four interventions on the trends of the debate on religious teaching in public schools in the states of Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo
