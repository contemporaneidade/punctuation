This paper discusses the unification of the Brazilian military and civilian police forces  concentrating the empirical references from previous studies on the police forces in the States of S o Paulo  Minas Gerais  and Rio de Janeiro  The approach does not focus on the efficiency of such a strategy in terms of crime control  Rather  the main preoccupation is with its legitimacy  as understood by the theory of organizations  Especially useful for this purpose is the concept of institutional field  The conclusion is that there is an incomplete institutionalization of the police field in Brazil  Throughout history  police forces have responded mostly to institutional demands from other fields  notably those of justice and defense  From this perspective  the unification proposal can be understood as an attempt to transform the nature of institutional demands directed towards police organizations
