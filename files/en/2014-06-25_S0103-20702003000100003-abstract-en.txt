Changes in the social sciences core curriculum of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro  UFRJ  do not influence student evasion rate  while their insertion into research projects through scientific training programs decreases  to a great extent  the levels of undergraduate student evasion  The study at the UFRJ compared curricula and evasion for the period of 1939 to 1988 and found that changes made to the curriculum occurred  markedly  according to political and social changes  They  however  followed the  logic of accumulation  that had small influence on the curriculum structure  since more subjects and disciplines were simply added to it  Comparing this historical experience to that of the scientific training program of the Social Research Laboratory  that worked from 1988 to 1997  we find very high averages of students finishing the graduation course  with solid academic training which allowed the majority of students to go on to work with the Social Sciences in their professional lives
