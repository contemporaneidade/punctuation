This article examines the contested idea of global democracy  It presents a world historical view of the evolution of global governance   how the political structure of the world system has evolved of over the past several centuries   and it examines contemporary social movements that are seeking to democratize global governance institutions  It is argued that those who want to democratize global governance must take up the problem of helping to further construct a global multilateral world state in order that the challenges that humanity has created for itself may be met in a collectively rational  sustainable and humane manner in the 21st century  Transnational social movements and progressive semiperipheral national states are seen as the agents that will challenge the powers that be and move humanity closer to a democratic and collectively rational global commonwealth in the next several decades
