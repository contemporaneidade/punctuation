The paper addresses some thematically related films on  executive unemployment  and dialogues with assessments of today s broadening of income insecurity and a particular ethos within the corporate universe  I particularly draw on the idea of the  spirit of capitalism  as formulated by Boltanski and Chiapello  1999  which includes the beliefs justifying the capitalist order and legitimating ways of action in accordance with it  but also the critiques addressed to the system in a certain period  A recent crop of films joins the critiques on the third spirit of capitalism  denouncing the constraints imposed on workers  but with a new approach  the anxiety of the executive echelons  whose security and possibility of reproduction is affected in the context of a flexible and globalized capitalism
