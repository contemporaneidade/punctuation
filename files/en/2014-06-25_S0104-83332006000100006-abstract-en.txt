Based upon an ethnographic study of children s break time in a primary school in S o Paulo  this article analyses the gender relations among children from 7 to 10 years old  We focus on the conflicting relationships between the sexes in an attempt to show the multiple forms of power play hidden behind apparently similar actions  By articulating the concept of conflict with simultaneous meanings of aggression and joking  we use the concept of  gender play  as one of the possible ways of sociability between boys and girls
