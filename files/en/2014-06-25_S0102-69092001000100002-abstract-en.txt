The article deals with the problem of democracy and its institutionalization and consolidation  Starting from the confrontation between a conventionally sociological perspective  which stresses the role of norms  and a rational choice perspective  which emphasizes the calculus referred to interests  the authors raise the issue of the role of cognitive factors with regard to both aspects  With recourse to survey data produced in Brazil some years ago  a rather complex mediating role is shown to be played by cognitive factors  described as  political sofistication  between the civic adherence to norms and the selfish or cynical promotion of self interest  Some implications of the observed patterns for the general theme of democracy are then explored
