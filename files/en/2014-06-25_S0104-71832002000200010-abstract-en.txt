This paper traces back the domestic mode of economic production that existed among the prehistoric Guarani  bringing together the archeological and ethno historic information about the past with the more current ethnographic and ethnological data on Guarani groups  By means of an analytical framework borrowed from economic anthropology  we can recognize the Guarani economic system as one founded on familiar relations of production  circulation and consumption of services  resources and goods  these relations are all subordinated to a Logic of Gift and Reciprocity  The Guarani economy is seen as field that is dependant upon the social field  Production is made so as to furnish the domestic unit with food and is founded on simple technology  without any complex division of labor and with relative freedom as to the use of resources  This paper also reflects upon how ideas from authors such as Karl Marx  Karl Polanyi  Maurice Godelier  and Marshall Sahlins may be applied for the Guarani economy
