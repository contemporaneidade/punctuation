The present article analyzes the role of information and communication technologies  ICTs  in the integration of the South American region  based on a study of regional security issues and cooperation between states  The study thus seeks to examine the scope of ICTs in building mutual trust between states and harmonization between maintenance of the domestic order and regional stability in a scenario marked by suspicion and political and institutional limitations  The argument is that the use of information technologies can contribute to the deepening of political processes  although in practice there is a lack of a coordinated strategy for South American countries to apply such technologies  The development of ICTs by UNASUL and the South American Defense Council thus emerges as an attempt to promote adequate alignment among initiatives for integration of South American countries and greater exchange of information to promote security and stability in the region
