This paper discusses the constitutive meanings of sexual initiation in youth  a time when  based on the choices of ideal partner and the use or non use of condoms  we see more clearly the grammar of gender relations in this population  The methodology used was ethnographic research  carried out among 42 young people   24 women and 18 men   between the ages of 15 and 19  from middle class families from the city of Pelotas  in the state of Rio Grande do Sul  This context highlights aspects of a traditional moral code in confrontation with the sexual initiation of men and women  We identify the perpetuation of a gender asymmetry where young women perceive themselves in a relational way  investing in the relationship  while young men seek to assert themselves as individuals through sexuality  The ficar  making out  emerges as an alternative form of affective involvement without commitment
