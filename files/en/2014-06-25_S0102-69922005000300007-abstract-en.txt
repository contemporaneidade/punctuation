The purpose of this article is to highlight some aspects that now characterize the convergence of the culture and the economy of symbols and spaces from the setting of a circuit of large festivals crossing different Brazilian regions  It is observed how the pattern of this circuit of events creates a broader portrait of the establishment of the service and urban industrial social structure  within which leisure and entertainment interfere with the level of values and expressions  with effects on the resignification of the realms of memory  On the other hand  it is also considered how those symbolic changes are fundamental to the very dynamics of the business of entertainment goods  in the sense that they articulate affection  endearment and life styles with the schemes of capital rentability
