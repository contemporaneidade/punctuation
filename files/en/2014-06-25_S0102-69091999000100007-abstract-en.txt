Examining the changes and attempted changes in French government policies on migration and nationality  such as the reformulation of the nationality code  the Pasqua Laws and the Debr  Law  from the mid 1980 s up to the present  this article argues the existence of a relationship between the making of these policies and the construction of national identity  This relationship has undergone significant changes due to the impact of the so called globalization process  Globalization implies a redesigning of the role of the nation state  which hitherto had a central part in the definition of national identity  The author contends that this process is bound to affect the relationship between the French national and the foreign national and  consequently  the formulation of the policies which regulate that relationship
