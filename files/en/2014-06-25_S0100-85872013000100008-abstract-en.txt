Based on ethnographic fieldwork  this paper analyzes liturgical strategies that are held by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God  UCKG  in the cities of Rome  Madrid and Barcelona  The focus of the analysis lies on the ways how such institution  in their various activities  that are defined as  healing  and the promise to cure any kind of problem   social  physical or spiritual  enables the intelligibility of concepts and practices for believers that are constituted mostly by immigrants of various nationalities  and also by members of local societies  The ethnographic data suggest that the therapeutic senses and efficacy symbolic  usually assigned by these believers groups  are particularly due to the capability of the UCKG to dialogue with such heterogeneous public  in socio cultural terms  and from national origins and previous religious experiences  but many cases presents important similarities  conceptions of the sacred that are linked with spiritual elements from beliefs and rites connected with esotericism  shamanism and  individual religious bricolages  The strategies analyzed evidence not only interculturality from a Brazilian neo Pentecostal church active in Europe  but also some dynamics of the religious sphere in this continent  previously exporter of religious doctrines and institutions and now a fertile field for missionary work
