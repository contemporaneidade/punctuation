This paper discusses the forms through which the education participates in the processes of social differentiation and construction of identities  It was focused on the school experience and the social paths of a group of former students of three feminine confessional schools of S o Paulo  who left school around 1960  The methodological procedures included questionnaires  semi structured in depth interviews with former students  directors and former teachers  consults to school files and ethnographic observations  The social origin of the families and of the nuns were linked to the characteristics of the students  academic formation and their ways of professionalization  The results suggest that the uses of private schools by the families in Brazil result in a homogeneous educational experience that potentializes the effects of the educational process on the modality of incorporation of class and gender stereotypes
