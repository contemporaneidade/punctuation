This paper examines the incorporation of the deliberations of the national conferences into the policy agenda of the Brazilian federal government and suggests aspects that affect the capacity of these public spaces to influence this process  The hypothesis is that the degree of incorporation of each conference  i e  its inclusive capacity  varies according to the nature of the public policy debated  given that each policy has its own purpose  involves a distinct type of civil society and is formulated by different public institutions  To test this proposition  the article compares the national conferences of aquaculture and fishery  of women and of racial policy  The results corroborate the assumption that conferences of distinct public policies have different inclusive capacity
