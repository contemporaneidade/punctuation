The paper examines several current characteristics of social sciences in Latin America  in parallel to the development of the subcontinent in recent years  The starting point is the sign that the contradictory combination in Latin America of an intellectuality that has a high cultural level and the existence of social and political movements in an explosive social situation creates wide possibilities for the development of sociology  The crisis of social sciences follows those significant changes  seeking new analytical perspectives able to demonstrate the pace of contemporary changes  Strictly speaking  the article tries to demonstrate that what Latin American sociology sees as novelty is a regression to the critical thinking that characterized it in the past  One of the most important legacies of Latin American sociological history is the study and classification  from a perspective of totality  of social structures and sociopolitical processes as a basis to examine actors  stances and the dynamics of social institutions  Therefore  there is room for a healthy trend in social sciences  overcoming empiricism  regaining theory  A founding need for Latin America today is to update its search for development  how is it possible to be up to the world  to universalize in order to live a historical moment with all its social potential  overcoming backwards and age worn ways of production and life  And more  how to co participate in the criticism of new modern and postmodern ways  envisaging new models of civilization  criticizing liberal democracy and Latin Americans  national States of competition  and encouraging the recovery of the democratic public in face of the tendency to state authoritarianism  The contributions that Latin America can give to the criticism and the renewal of democratic politics  to the reform of production and life  and to humanism and renewed radical communitarianism have to meet the old aims of national and social liberation of today s world  adjusted to the new conditions
