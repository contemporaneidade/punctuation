The MAS  the ruling party in Bolivia led by president Evo Morales  is generally labeled as populist or revolutionary  This paper challenges both diagnosis and sustains that the MAS is a social democratic party  Both in its genesis and in its behaviour in opposition  as well as in its policies in government  the MAS presents all the sufficient traits to be labeled as representative of social democracy  In order to dispute the dominant diagnosis in literature  the argument is developed applying three different approaches on social democracy  a historical ideological comparison with parties which use to be labeled as social democratic  an institutional analysis of what the MAS has done both in opposition and after getting in the Presidency  and an evaluation of party s policies in government  A comparison to non controversial cases of social democracy shows that the MAS resembles them both in its strongly unionist origin and in the kind of changes it introduced in the country  The accusations that the MAS is anti systemic and opposes democracy  traits which are associated both to  populists  according to the  authors of the two lefts  and to parties that favor the  violent revolution  are refused by the institutional analysis  Finally  evaluating the policies from the MAS in government we can see that they are in line with those which are considered social democratic in the scope of the integration of global markets  This paper challenges current literature calling attention to some aspects usually neglected by scholars  In the text  it is argued that the MAS does not use to be labeled as social democratic partially due to misunderstanding of what it does and partially due to a tendency to call attention to what is specific to the movement and not to what is similar to other leftwing parties  as it is done with all parties when we classify them inside families
