This article examines the hipotheses that the political and moral theory of egalitarian liberalism provides a sound justification for ethnic and race based affirmative action  something that has been deemed true by academics and Supreme Coutr justices in Brazil  We proceed by analysing how key authors associated with egalitarian liberalism  such as John Rawls  Ronald Dworkin  Thomas Nagel e Robert Taylor  approached the subject  The method used for such analysis was textual interpretation  which was conducted as close as possible to each author s language and concepts  Our endeavor covered the evolution of the theme in the works of each one  with a special focus to Rawls s contribution  Instead of a single connection  we found that there is a gradation of opinions regarding the topic  which stretches from the explicit justification of these policies to their entire rejection on moral grounds  Therefore  our results show that there inequivocal link between the moral and political theory of egalitarian liberalism and the justification of ethnic and race based affirmative action  despite common sense and the fact that liberal egalitarians and the advocates of affirmative action often share the same location on the political spectrum in liberal democractic societies
