The Kaingang are an Amerindian society  of the J  linguistic group  who live in the southern region of Brazil  Among the Kaingang there are shamans  called kui  who arise only from one portion  the Kam  moiety  and who have an auxiliary animal associated to their original group  It is as if the Kaingang shamanism involved  on the sociological level  one half of the group  a moiety that is solely occupied  without any complementarity or sharing  with the field of practice  Such a division is in stark contrast with all other ritual aspects of the Kaingang  for their rituals are characterized by the complementary obligation between members of the Kam  and Kairu moieties  If we compare the Kaingang case with the Bororo  we can see that the Kaingang division contrasts with the Bororo s asymmetry and necessary complementarity  In the Bororo case  the bope shamans are usually from the Tugarege moiety  while the aroe shamans are usually from the Exarae moiety  For the Bororo  the bope and aroe shamans complement each other  one being the reverse of the other  and both determine the two related ideological opposites of the Bororo society  The Kaingang shamanism  in contrast to the Bororo s  seems to correspond to the most narrow form of the hierarchical principle   as an opposition of the hierarchical kind  defined as a relationship of the encompassing encompassed type  where the elements are related by an opposition  One element  Kam  is identical to the whole and encompasses the other element  Kairu  of the relationship  Such dualism allows useful contrasts to come up  depending on varied and changeable contexts  These contrasts are based on quite simple principles  sameness and difference  one and multiple  center and outskirts  male and female  high and low  etc  Determining the relationship between the moieties in a society with a dualistic organization is important   as the Kaingang and Bororo cases illustrate   to comprehend the complementary and asymmetrical role that each moiety plays constituting both the institution and the practice of shamanism  The present study reveals the need and interest of extending such a comparison to other J  societies
