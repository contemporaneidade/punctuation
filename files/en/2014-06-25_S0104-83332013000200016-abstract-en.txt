Based on an ethnographic fieldwork carried out within the Parliamentary Inquiry Committee  PIC  on Pedophilia  in the Brazilian Federal Senate  and the police inquiries of the Federal Police Department  the aim of this paper is to analyze the interconnection between the construction of  pedophilia  as both a political cause and a police case and the consequent production of the  pedophile  as the contemporary monster  In the ethnographic description of the public arena of the PIC  special attention is conferred to the centrality of emotions and to the political use of the images of child pornography  In the police investigations  on the other hand  the focus is directed to the police action of identification of  facts  and incrimination of the  culprit  Finally  it is suggested that the main  targets  of this  antipedophilia crusade  are blamed not so much for what they do  share  distribute  acquire  possess or store pornographic images involving minors  but because of the dangers associated with their desires  The hypothesis of the paper is that this is the main reason for the common confusion between  child pornography on the internet  and  pedophilia  in the public discourses
