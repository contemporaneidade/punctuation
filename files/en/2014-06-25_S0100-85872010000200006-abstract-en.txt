This article examines the movement of churches in Brazil that call themselves  inclusionary  and identified in the media between 1990 and 2000 as  gay churches  It focuses on the rise of the Metropolitan Community Church in Brazil   a well known activist denomination created in 1968 in the United States and its transformation into the Contemporary Christian Church  It analyzes how this church established itself based on local influences and a dialog with ideas from hegemonic religious systems  The paper argues that the implantation of this group encompasses regional variations provided by notions that come from the passages and mediations realized by the subjects between their communities of origin and their adhesion to a new religious alternative  It examines some models and images of homosexuality cultivated and produced in this plural movement
