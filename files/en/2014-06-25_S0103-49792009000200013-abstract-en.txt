This paper analyzes the problem of the order and control production in Brazilian prisons  using the historical and sociological perspectives  and brings the hypotheses that  in Brazil  two modalities of construction of order and control in the prisons happen together  One of them  minoritary  is based on the State s prerogative of daily prisional administration  The other regards the negotiation of the prison pacification between the State and the prisoners  leaderships  Although  in the first case  the prerogative of the State can be linked to the appropriate institutional conditions and  in the second  negotiation between the State and the prisoners  leaderships  to such precarious conditions of the prisons  as overcrowding  reduced number of penitentiary agents  the analysis pointed out that both modalities translate forms of relationships and social interactions historically produced among the State and society  that go to the foundation of the Republic  recreated through the social actors  habitus  not limiting exclusively to the social space of the prisons
