In this paper I compare the grade transition rates  repetition  promotion and drop out  given by the Education Ministry Statistics Office based in the school census data with rates form PROFLUXO  a mathematical model wich allows us to get theses indicators through the use of IBGE s PNADs  National Household Sample Survery  The picture we get from these indicators shows that MEC s methodology leads to serious errors witch distort the vision of Brazilian educational reality  Opossite to MEC s data it shows that the rates of school drop put are very low in the initial grades of elementary school  This finding leads to the understanting that the notion of child s early drop out from school caused by social on cultural determinants is misleading and that Brazilian families  on the contrary  make an enourmous effort to keep their children a school  On the other hand it shows die low teaching performance which prevents  through high repetition rates  the universalization of Elementary Education in Brazil
