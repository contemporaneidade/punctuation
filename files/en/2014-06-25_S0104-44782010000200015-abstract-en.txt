The Brazilian parliament has been characterized by the large amount of parliamentary fronts created in recent years  Common interpretations  usually based on  managerial  and normative conceptions of political domination  associate this with the fragility of alignments and of party loyalty  or with the  pragmatism  of politicians  Taking federal representatives from the 2002 2006 period as our empirical universe  we seek to demonstrate that these parliamentary fronts are not the product of party fragility  but rather a specific configuration of modes of relationship regarding interest group action and the political scenario  Thus  participation in parliamentary fronts can be directly associated with activities of expertise and the politicization of organized interests  Furthermore  this participation also depends directly on the respective conditions of participation and social and political trajectories  This includes positions within political party cleavages and confrontations  notwithstanding the fact that it represents a pattern of political domination that is different from the so called  pluralist model  that is usually taken as a normative reference
