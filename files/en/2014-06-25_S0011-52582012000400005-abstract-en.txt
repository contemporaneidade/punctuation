Do Brazil s political parties matter in elections  The article focuses on this problem by analyzing whether a mayor s election influences his party s electoral performance in the same city  A regression discontinuity model  RDM  was used to identify the causal effect of mayors on their party s electoral performance in elections to National and State Deputies  The findings suggest that a mayor s election  even by a difference of only 1  should increase the votes for the same party in the elections to both National and State Deputy  This result is interpreted as evidence of intra partisan linkage  whereby mayors act systematically to help elect National and State Deputies from their own parties
