We trace the origins and development of the annual Meeting of the Rain Prophets  held in Quixad  Cear  demonstrating how the invention of this tradition depends on the circulation of public  academic and media discourses in order to achieve the goal of preserving the culture imagined to exist in the rural Northeast  We examine the intersection between culture and folklore  analizing the collaboration of individuals  media and researchers  including anthropologists  in the production of culture related to rain prediction  We show how texts produced by the media and researchers enter into public discourse about the rain prophets  In these ways  we are simultaneously inventing and preserving a tradition  Taking a close look at the intertextuality of media  academic and public discourses about the rain prophets  we contribute to debates about the influence our work has on the knowledge and practices we study
