This article explores the reasons behind the fact that European institutions have decided to establish a new Constitutional treaty  while portions of the national societies have shown signs of resistance to it  The hypothesis is that causes similar to those involved in previous crises  like Maastricht  also help explain the current crisis  and that problems of supranational legitimization should also be elucidated by the analysis of transnational articulations in the region  By verifying distortions in the social perception of the role of institutions and the Constitution and the growth of the extreme right in Europe  interpreted in the historical context of integration  we highlight the importance of identity and the relationship between the lack of social unity and the movements against integration  calling for a change in the current dimensions of European politics
