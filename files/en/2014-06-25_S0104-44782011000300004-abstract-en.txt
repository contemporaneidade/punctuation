In the present article  we proceed from a discussion of Pierre Bourdieu s structural constructivism to an approach to the juridical field  as distinguishable from the judicial field  in consonance with Bourdieu s own proposal  The judicial field can be understood as a sub field within the juridical field and as an institution providing professional monopoly over the production and commercialization of juridical services  in virtue of juridical and social competence or of a specific enabling power regarding the constitution of the juridical judicial object  This signifies the ability to transform a social reality  a grievance  conflict or dispute  into a judicial juridical reality  We then go on to analyze the different interpretive currents on the workings of institutional mechanisms of conflict management in Brazil  keeping in mind the existence of distinct logics for state management of conflicts  or intensity of interaction  that correspond to hierarchies of ritual  people and types of conflict  Our argument proceeds as follows  interpreting Law through the concepts and authors used here  recognizing the strength and violence of juridical forms  as well as their historical use as mechanisms for producing and reproducing hierarchies and social inequalities and admitting that the institutions of justice are always vulnerable to their subversion by those who hold political economic power  we see that when social demands become juridical ones there is always a possibility that the need for their legal justification reduces their discretionary space
