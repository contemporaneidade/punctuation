The increased inclusion of race in Brazilian public debate  the increase of its usage in opinion polls and monitoring and the ease with which it has been included in statistical models has created a paradox regarding its importance  While skin color has been gaining salience in public debate  it has also lost substantive importance as a complex and dynamic social construct through the superficial way in which it is being employed   as a permanent and immutable category   in quantitative studies  This bibliographic essay discusses the factors that have contributed to such a tendency  looking at national and international literature produced over the last 10 years  We question the use of race in public policies  inquiring into its trustworthiness  variability and validity  and consider the limitations and possibilities of using race as a marker of difference  The essay concludes by suggesting a research agenda meant to increase understanding and reduce the uncertainties associated with the usage of  race  as a variable in quantitative studies
