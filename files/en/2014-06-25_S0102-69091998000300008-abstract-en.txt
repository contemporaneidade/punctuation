The paper develops a processual analysis of sociality as it is constructed on a daily basis by the Cashinahua  an Amazonian people  It discusses critically the use made by anthropological analyses of the region of the term  sociability  questioning the tendency to see the  domestic  as inferior to the  public  or the  local  as encompassed by the  global  I argue for a greater emphasis on the economic cycle of production and distribution  exchange and consumption  giving a central place within this economy to the complex process whereby gender is fabricated  The critical discussion is expanded through a brief ethnographic excursion  showing the central place occupied by Cashinahua women in the constitution of sociality
