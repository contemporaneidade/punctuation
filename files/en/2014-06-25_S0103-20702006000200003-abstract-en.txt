The author raises questions about unequal access to scientific knowledge whose consequences affect human well being  control over production of that knowledge  control over its distribution  and access to that knowledge by people whose well being it will or could affect  I will try to show how and why they matter  the problem of access to scientific knowledge involves agency  identity  and freedom  It involves those themes in three different ways  First  the production and distribution of scientific knowledge depends on knowledgeable agents who almost inevitably hoard their knowledge to the differential advantage of themselves and their sponsors  Second  control over scientific knowledge organizes around identity defining boundaries between those who have rights to that knowledge and those who lack such rights  Third  overcoming the barriers between beneficiaries and victims of unequal access ordinarily requires heroic agency on the part of advocates and political authorities
