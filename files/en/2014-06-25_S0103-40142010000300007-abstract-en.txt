The discovery of gene silencing mechanisms in our own cells using RNA interference is very recent  However  in less than a decade  the scientific investigation have progressed enough to make us see that  very soon  we will use this knowledge for therapeutic purposes  RNA duplexes are potential pharmaceutical drugs and there are high investments in this new strategy  The promising gene therapy seems to finally reach maturity with these new tools
