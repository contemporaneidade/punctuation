Taking the labor and conflicts point of view  this article discusses the emergence of a new agenda for development in Brazil  Its focus is the construction worker protests and strikes at two of the Suape Port Industrial Complex s main sites  the Abreu e Lima Refinery and the Suape Petrochemical Plant  in 2011 and 2012  Through the use of this approach we intend to comprehend the processes touched off by the conflicts  mediations  and negotiations  as well as what has been at stake with workers  demands and also union  management and government discourse and practices  We ask ourselves if these mobilizations  besides giving them immediate gains  have given workers recognition as legitimate agents of social demands  We also ask to what degree such demands have become not only a target of public outcry but also a way of problematizing the terms that give sustenance to the new development discourse
