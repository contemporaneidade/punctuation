Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s  Brazil has witnessed the proliferation of forums  councils  committees and partnerships that have instituted institutional channels open for the political expression of actors and segments of civil society at the different levels of government and over a wide range of areas of State action  Nonetheless  the literature that analyzes this process has  to a large extent  adopted a dichotomous and normative view of civil society  We put forth a need to break with static and substantialist views of civil society  through adoption of a processbased and relational approach allowing us to analyze the process that constructs social actors in their relation to other actors and institutions  particularly  with the political and institutional field  Thus  the present paper represents more of a theoretical and methodological proposal than a presentation of research results  Our goal is to look critically at the literature that employs a normative and stylized approach to civil society and propose the incorporation of a political networks approach for the discussion and analysis of processes of formation and engagement of actors from civil society and  more specifically   of how these processes are related to institutional spaces of participation  As an instrument for methodological operationalization of the  political networks approach  we propose social network analysis  This method of analysis permits the apprehension of the processes of formation and engagement of actors from civil society through their belonging to a relational and dynamic space where actors with distinct institutional connections  civil society  the State  the market  can be found
