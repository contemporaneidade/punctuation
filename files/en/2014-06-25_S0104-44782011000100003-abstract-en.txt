Democracy is one of the most widely discussed themes in Political Science  There is unanimous agreement regarding the legitimacy of the democratic regime in the face of those that oppose it  Nonetheless  if there is consensus on the defense of democracy  there is no analogous consensus regarding what the concept really means  Debate on the theme re emerges as a consequence of the crisis of political representation in countries where democracy has been consolidated  of the fall of authoritarian regimes in eastern Europe  Asia and Latin America and the incertainties surrounding consolidation of democratic regimes  This article analyzes some of the inflections that are present in democratic theory  particularly on issues that involve the relationship between democracy  the logic of collective action  political representation  interest and accountability  We begin by presenting Max Weber s influence on Joseph Schumpeter s theory of democracy  followed by the bases of his minimalism  his influence on Robert Dahl s pluralism  the paradoxes of the logic of collective action and of economic theory of democracy  We then go on to particular aspects of concepts of political representation  responsibility  interest  forming of preferences and general will  We find that the meaning of political representation has become increasingly complex  particularly because its practice has not been consonant with the  ideal of popular representation in politics  that is characteristic of democratic utopia  There is a clear hiatus between the demand for more representation and how in fact the latter materializes within society  Nonetheless  we argue that  notwithstanding all the criticisms it has received  democracy as a system of government survives under different social and historical conditions and this happens because all democratic regimes share one common feature  representative institutions  Without them  democracy is a mere fiction
