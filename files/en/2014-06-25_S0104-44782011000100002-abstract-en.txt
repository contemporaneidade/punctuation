The Theory of the State  in the field of Political Science  has undergone moments of crisis  particularly in the passage from the 1980s to the 1990s  when exponents of certain intellectual currents argued that the Nation State and state institutions were losing their central position as objects of analysis  The present article counters this argument and attempts a comparative analysis of two of the most systematic authors who dealt with the concept of the modern State and its relationship with modern Law  Hans Kelsen and Nicos Poulantzas  Our point of departure is the analogy was established between the two by David Easton  in his article   The Political System under State Siege  in which he identifies Poulantzas  Marxist work with Kelsen s systemic and normative work on Law and the State  In fact  paradoxically  Poulantzas may be seen as in agreement with many aspects of Kelsen s critique of liberal thought  a school to which the latter is in fact affiliated  as well as with his definition of the State of Law as the antithesis of authoritarian States  Yet despite this convergence  the differences between Poulantzas and Kelsen are representative of two distinct forms of political and theoretical treatment of the concepts of Law and the State  For Kelsen  the State is impermeable  not riven by internal contradictions or fissures  while for Poulantzas  the State is defined as a strategic field of struggles  permeated by micro policies and contradictions  The present article consists of an introduction  which is then followed by two sections that present a synthesis of Kelsen s and Poulantzas  positions on the role of the modern State and the Law  and providing a concluding section in which the major points of agreement and disagreement in the work of these authors are pointed out
