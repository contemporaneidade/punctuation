Starting from the recent emphasis that nation theory has been giving to the  imagined  and or  constructed  character of the national community  the paper looks for connections with anthropological theory and analyses the implications for anthropologys perspective on national and ethnic identities  In particular  following the traditionally strong empirical orientation of the discipline  it also interprets these theoretical assumptions bearing in mind possible developments in ethnographic research regarding the formation and politics of identity in national settings  In this context  the paper sketches the concept of a  discourse anthropology  with examples from research on national identity in Germany and Brazil  The analysis of these two cases leads to a theoretical distinction between discourse centred  Germany  and symbol centred  Brazil  constructions of national identity
