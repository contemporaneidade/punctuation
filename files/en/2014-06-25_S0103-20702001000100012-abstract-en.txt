This is essentially a theoretical article and it aims to present a non exhaustive analysis of the sociology of deviance  emphasizing interactionist theories  A brief account of the emergence of the sociology of deviance in Chicago is followed by a discussion on three tendencies that are involved in analyzing the causes of deviance  functionalism  anomie and culturalism  Next  interactionism arises as a means to break up with the causal approach  The specificity of the interactionist theory  especially H  Becker s Labelling Theory  can be seen in collective action and in the emphasis on the social process through which an individual or a group is considered deviant by the others  Finally  a few of the more recent tendencies are mentioned  such as phenomenology and ethnomethodology  and the criticism directed at these theories  mainly by Pierre Bourdieu  are discussed
