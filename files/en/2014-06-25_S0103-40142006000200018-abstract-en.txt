THE PRODUCTIVE reorganization induced new contours in the spatial redistribution of economic activities  which  in turn  influenced the spatial redistribution of the Brazilian population  This paper seeks to identify the spatial patterns of migratory flows in Brazil  attempting to relate them with the new locational requirements of the deconcentration of economic and interurban activities  For such  the main migratory networks of Brazil have been delimited  both for the more educated and less educated populations  The evidences point to an increasing channelization of population flows  mainly in relation to the networks of more educated migrants  Concomitantly  those migratory movements of longer distance  that characterized the periods of occupation of the agricultural mineral frontiers and the movements of low human capital workers toward industrial regions  experienced a notorious weakening process
