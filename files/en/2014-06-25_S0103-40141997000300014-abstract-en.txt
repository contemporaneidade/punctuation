There are a number of important works that analyse the clash between adolescents or pre adolescents and the hostile school environment in Western literature  The essay initially outlines the themes that characterise these  school stories  It then defines the characteristics of these themes and at the same time tries to determine the specificities of this literary genre through a comparison between the novels O Ateneu  1888  and Die Verwirrungen des Z glings T rless  1906  In these strongly autobiographical works  Raul Pomp ia and Robert Musil incorporate traces of behaviour and types of mentality that became evident in the historical reality some decades later into their narratives about the traumatic school experiences of S rgio and T rless  This essay also extends the comparative study  though in a succinct way  to the  Novelle  Katz und Maus  1961  where G nter Grass makes the clash between the teenager Joachim Mahlke and his school a starting point for a radical criticism of the national socialist society  The speculative end of this essay tries to give a general view of the ideological  pedagogical and existential depths of these short narratives which apparently deal only with the ordinary drama of school life
