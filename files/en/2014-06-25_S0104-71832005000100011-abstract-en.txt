The University of Brasilia  UnB  was the first Brazilian federal university to adopt racial quotas as part of its admission procedures  reserving 20  of places in all courses for  black  students  The system came into effect in the second semester of 2004  The university s initiative generated intense debate not only in the academic community but throughout Brazilian society  in particular because the means adopted to decide eligibility under the program was to set up a commission that determined the racial identity of candidates by analyzing their photographs  The university bureaucracy  allied with the black movement  chose this method to deal with a sensitive socio political issue  The aim was to privilege black Brazilians in order to remedy historical injustices  and at the same time eliminate potential  racial cheaters  by setting supposedly objective parameters  The application of these criteria  influenced by a kind of racial anatomical psychology  led to a period of wide spread scientific and political dispute  especially because the criteria themselves were highly controversial  A particularly significant aspect of the University of Brasilia case is that it requires us to think about the uses and abuses of anthropology  since on a technical level the practice of anthropology was invoked as  racial expertise  Our purpose in this paper is to reflect on the context of this case  which  although specific  points to the wider involvement  and to the uses  of anthropology in the dynamics of contemporary political and social processes
