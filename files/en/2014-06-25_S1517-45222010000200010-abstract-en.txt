Territorial development involves the organized participation of social actors in decisions regarding the use of the public   and  largely  private   resources of a region  Despite the obvious democratic virtues of the participatory processes  there has been a recent increase in the critical literature  questioning their results  This paper intends to reveal the tension experienced by the contemporary social movements  the conflict between representativeness and innovation  Representative movements tend to consolidate and strengthen interests  and their institutionalization pushes them towards routine attitudes that often block their innovative potential  One way out of the impasses of the social movements is in the terms of management of the social participation focused explicitly on learning and innovation  Organizations coming from social movements are an essential part of the participatory processes  This article  based on the example of the Brazilian policy of strengthening family agriculture  examines two of those organizations whose origin is in the social movements  the Federa o dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura Familiar   FETRAF  Federation of Workers in Family Farming  which is a trade union  and the CRESOL System of cooperatives for credit outreach  Both organizations stimulate participatory processes and are associated with government policies  In the case of the trade union  however  social participation does not result in innovation  and the ties with the government tend to restrict the movement to relations already known  As regards the credit cooperative  social participation and ties with the government are the result of incentives that encourage the strengthening of what the new economic sociology calls weak ties  and thus open the way to expand the very foundations of the processes of local development
