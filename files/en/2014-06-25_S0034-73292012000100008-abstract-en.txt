This work looks at the role of the Foreign Ministry in Fernando Collor s foreign policy  which is usually considered feeble  We argue that  instead of putting Itamaraty on the sidelines  the president reconfigured the ministry  both in terms of its key decision makers and in administrative terms  The outcome was the establishment of a more liberal foreign policy   a mitigated Americanism   in tune with the traditional goals of Brazil s foreign relations
