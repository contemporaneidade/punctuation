The decision of the United States government to intervene in Cuba  in April 1961  was the result of a combination of historical and political factors  Among them  the history of US interference in the Caribbean context  both directly  between the beginning of the 20th century up to the first years of the 1930 s  and  later on  indirectly  the successful interventions promoted by the CIA in Iran  1953  and Guatemala  1954  as well as the political  need  domestically  of recently elected president Kennedy to demonstrate how committed he was with containing communism  Thus  no single factor can solely explain the decision to go ahead with the plan  which turned out to be a huge political failure for the US government
