In his last political writings  Weber engaged in intense debate around the challenges that Germany faced at that particular historical moment  Focusing on the end of the Second Empire and the first steps taken by the Weimar Republic  the author examined the preference for a parliamentary model of democracy over its plebiscitary variety  The present paper revisits this discussion up and seeks to situate it within the context of the political evolution of Weber s thought  At the same time  it seeks to reconstruct Weber s argument  highlighting the role that the theme of institutions  democracy and rationality play in his evaluation of parliamentary and plebiscitary models of democracy  Finally  we return to the earlier issues to suggest a theoretical agenda that demonstrates the possibilities and current relevance of the problems contained in the political sociology that emerges from Weber s political conjunctural writings
