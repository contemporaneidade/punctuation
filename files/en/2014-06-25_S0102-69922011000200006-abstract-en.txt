Starting with the assumption that it is possible to apprehend the formation of structures of feeling from literature  I make a case for the presence of two iconic moments for the interweaving of these with respect to their effects on the building of a sense of national identity in both Brazil and Mozambique  The first moment is the anti colonial struggle in Africa starting in the 1940 s  At this time there was a wave of Brazilian literature towards the countries colonized by the Portuguese  on which sailed a structure of feeling of harmonious mestizo  The second moment refers to a flow from Africa to Brazil where a structure of affirmative feeling  mature in the post independence period of the former colonies influences  already in the 21st century  a feeling of sentiment emerging in Brazilian society  which we could call an africanized structure of feeling
