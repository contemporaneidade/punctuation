Mobon is a catholic movement established under the influence of the Second Vatican Council  1962 1965  and played an important role in rural communities in Zona da Mata  Minas Gerais  The ideal of a strong co responsibility between the clergy and laity was a hallmark of this movement  which offered courses to community organizations and layman leaderships to become more independent from local clerics  In these courses  metaphors and symbolic representations of the rural environment were used for a better comprehension  aiming for strong laity engagement  The present text aims to analyze this process of community action of the Catholic Church  emphasizing the key role played by the communicative praxis in the relational process between missionaries and layman Catholic groups
