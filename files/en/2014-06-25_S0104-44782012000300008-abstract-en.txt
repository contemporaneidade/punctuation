This article examines the hypothesis that  since World War II  there has been intergenerational change in the fundamental values of particular segments of the population in some Western European countries  Values have shifted  as it were  from prioritizing economic security and social order  acquisitive values  to intellectual and artistic expression and radical social change  post bourgeois  values  We have tested this hypothesis through a questionnaire applied to a variety of social groups  Although the  post bourgeois  respondents are more likely to be youth  our argument here is that the changes we note should not be attributed to a stage in the life cycle in which people tend to be more open to change and bear less family and social burden  rather  they reflect a deep shift in values linked to the economic affluence of Western European countries after 1945  This change in values also influences political activities and political party preferences  leading  above all  to the emergence and consolidation of a  New Left
