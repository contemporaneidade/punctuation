This article attempts to contribute to improving our understanding of the relationship between Internet use  on the one hand  and the political participation of citizens  on the other  We emphasize the factors that determine regular internet use and user profiles in relation to political values and participation  Analysis of data from the Latinobar metro 2007 survey indicate age and educational level as primary determinants of Internet use in Brazil  Occupation  as well as a proxy used for income did not have a consistent impact on people s probabilities of connecting  thus contrasting Brazilian data with data on Argentine and Chilean cases  At the same time  the public belonging to the on line community demonstrated greater mobilization  in terms of traditional forms of political participation  and little differentiation in terms of political opinions  when compared to non users of this new technology  This evidence suggests that connection to the digital world tends to enhance the voice of segments of the population that already enjoy privileged access to government and public policy managers  particularly given their cultural capital  although there are some signs of existing opportunities for other segments of society sectors  It also indicates that the importance of the country s  digital divide  can be relativized  since internauts do not hold opinions that are significantly different from those of the rest of the population
