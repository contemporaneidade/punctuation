The conceptual field for discussions of democracy has generally been territorially delimited  For ancient democracy the territory was that of a city state  for modern democracy a national state  Although modern democracy has from the late eighteenth century been in many ways quite a different set of institutions and practices than ancient democracy and although modern democracy has continually undergone significant change  the notion of delimited territoriality has remained a central assumption  In the early twenty first century  however  there are many reasons to anticipate a major conceptual shift  The web of transnational connection  the development of transnational structures of decision making  from the EU to the IMF  and the vast disparity in wealth and power among the national states are calling into question the democracy of the national states  Although the multicontinental wave of democratizations of the late twentieth century brought about the most geographically extensive implantation of democratic national governments in history  public opinion research in many countries shows significant dissatisfaction with democracy as currently practiced  not just in recently democratized countries but in the more established democracies as well  Some are suggesting that what is needed is the democratization of transnational structures  But can democracy meaningfully exist on a scale beyond the national states  On the conceptual level  there are many reasons to be skeptical  Issues include whether the weakness of cross border solidarities and identities preclude cross border democracy  whether administrative structures of vast geographic scope can be made genuinely accountable to citizenry  and whether wealthy and powerful states will accede to larger structures constraining their autonomy
