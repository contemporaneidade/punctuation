In the 18th century  Scottish scholars identified the paradox that social sciences would have to face later on  history is made by human beings  though it does not obey a human plan  In this article  we reconstruct the rank of this central problem in the tradition of the sociological theory  We start from the analysis of Adam Smith  in his attempt to build a social science of wealth production  Then we deal with the first theses of Robert K  Merton in the domain of the sociological theory  We examine the way in which Raymond Boudon analyzes the problem from the perspective of methodological individualism and the way that Anthony Giddens incorporates this paradox in his explanation of social reproduction  In a preliminary evaluation  we point out the limitations of Mertonian functionalism in explaining nonintentional effects of intentional action  although  at the same time  we emphasize that methodological individualism does not provide an alternative concept for causality  In the end  we lay out the ideological debate that unfastens this paradox between structuralist and reductionist sociologies
