In this work we aim at pointing out the role of education in the constitution of a democratic society  The relationship between democracy and education is established by the identification of the predicates of the first  mainly from the contributions of Karl Mannheim  and the properties of the latter  especially in its political dimension  supporting the convergence between curricular processes and social needs  Based on Brazilian reality  we assert that the construction of a democratic conscience and personality stems from the achievement of another sociability  which is consonant with the values of reciprocity and cooperation  as much as sensible to the qualification of the terms that define  objectively and subjectively  the quality of life  Such quality stems  moreover  from the development of critical interpretations and or creative proposals created as a result of and by everyday experience  Considering the precarious nature of our citizenship  as much as the ongoing educational challenges  we therefore highlight the challenge of the political education for educators  If observed and developed within ethical political relations common to the teacher knowledge and know how  this formative dimension can offer a humanist connotation to the process of school socialization  especially by taking into account the needs and difficulties of the popular class  More than that  it may mean the necessary mediation  although still insufficient  between the democratic project and democratic society  or even between social reality and contexts of citizenship  as well as between political needs and social change
