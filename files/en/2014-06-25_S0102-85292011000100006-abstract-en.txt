In this paper  I investigate the image of Paraguay that is conveyed in Brazil  how it is constructed and what forms it  I am interested both in the interpretation of historical events that marked relations between the two countries  and selective spatial representations of Paraguay circulating in Brazil  Particular attention is paid to the Brazilian perceptions and representations of migration flows that form on either side of the international border  this is to say Brazilian migrants in Paraguay and Paraguayan migrants in Brazil  because international migrations  as contact situations  are responsible for the production of reciprocal representations
