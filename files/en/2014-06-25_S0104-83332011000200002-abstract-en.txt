The context is the Partition of India in 1949  with the creation of Pakistan  as seen from the point of view of Punjabi culture  the Punjab was the province closer to the frontiers of the new state  and particularly through the eyes of Asha  a widow 21 years old in 1941  who lived with his deceased husband s family  The transformations derived from the Partition give rise to Asha s following reflections  A daughter s food is never heavy on her parents  But how long will one s parents live  When two pieces of bread are experienced as heavy by one s own brother  then it is better to keep one s honor  make one s peace   and live where one was destined to live  The exegesis of this text is the analytical nucleus of the text  The author is not asking how the events of the Partition were present to consciousness as past events but how they came to be incorporated into the temporal structure of relationships
