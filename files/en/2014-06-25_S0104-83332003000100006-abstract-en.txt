Julia Mann was the matriarch of the famous family of German writers  This paper uses the recent interest in her Brazilian origin to discuss the theme of nationality associated with categories of gender and race  We show the historicity of social categories and the way they determine the self understanding of individuals in a specific time  Nineteenth century German society characterized Julia as a  Brazilian  and  despite the stigma this category brought along with it  Julia used this  exotic  origin as a way for her self understanding and for her resistance to the racist society in which she lived
