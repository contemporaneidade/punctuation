Based upon the study of a conflict that erupted between Bolivian immigrants in Buenos Aires over the concept of  8220 slave labor 8221  in the city 8217 s sweatshops  the present article deals with the relationship between  western  rights and Aymara or Andean cultural forms  How are these work relations qualified when they involve Bolivian Andeanworkers and owners  or administrators  Aymara culture problematizes the concept of labor exploitation and vice versa  The present article focuses on the transnational migratory circuit and heterogeneous circulations  of people  money  objects  knowledge and practices  that it contains in order to better comprehend this conflict  Based upon an analysis of the lived  networked experience of rights and Aymara cultural traces  I propose to interlink and juxtapose the social  cultural economic and political logics and institutuions that are constituitive components of these processes of circulation
