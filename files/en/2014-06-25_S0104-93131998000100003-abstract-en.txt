Until quite recently  indigenous peoples in the Brazilian Northeast were not the object of systematic investigation  rather appearing to inspire a kind of secondary  lesser ethnology  According to the author  this oversight resulted from a difficulty in applying the premises of Americanist anthropology to such cultures  since the latter operates with societal models emphasizing both cultural discontinuity and the objectivity and externality of the observed vis vis the researcher and his her society  By establishing a dialogue with different theoretical perspectives  the author delineates or reworks several notions  such as  territorialization   colonial situation   diaspora  and  return journey  allowing him to produce a comprehensive analysis of the historical process which turned such populations into the current ethnic groups  Finally  he suggests that studies on  mixed Indians   i e  relations between ethnic groups in areas of very old colonization  in Brazil and elsewhere can help construct an anthropology that is better articulated with history
