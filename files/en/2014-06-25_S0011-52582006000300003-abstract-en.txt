This article conducts a theoretical confrontation between the thinking of Max Weber and that of Friedrich Nietzsche concerning the modern Western world  based on the notions of  death of God  and  disenchantment of the world  The article explores the affinities and differences between the two thinkers  especially from the angle of Weber s diagnosis of the  culture of technique  and its inexorable effects on subjectivity  The paper s underlying hypothesis is that despite the parallels that can  and should  be drawn between the two  what prevails is an insurmountable distance  especially by the recognition of the powers of reason and the vision of a cultural world edified under the command of conscious orientations
