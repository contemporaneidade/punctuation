Regimes are defined by institutionalist theories in the discipline of International Relations as formal or informal sets of norms and rules that create patterns of behavior and allow the convergence of the expectations of their participants in specific issue areas  in order to solve coordination problems that could lead to non pareto efficient outcomes  Considering that such definitions based merely on the  efficiency  of regimes do not seem to be sufficient to explain their effectiveness  the present article proposes a different definition for regimes  political arrangements that allow a redistribution of the gains of cooperation among the participants in certain issue areas  within an interdependence context  Regimes would thus be effective due to their autonomy and relevance   that is  due to their objective existence autonomously from their participants and their influence on the participants  behavior and expectations in ways that cannot be reduced to the individual action of any of them  This article begins with a brief discussion about terminological problems related to regime studies and with a definition of the concepts of autonomy and relevance  Then it classifies the authors that take part in this debate according to two distinct perspectives  one that denies  non autonomists  and the other that attributes  autonomists  autonomy and relevance to regimes  briefly analyzing the authors and traditions that are more significant for this debate  focusing on autonomist authors and on arguments that back the hypothesis here presented  Finally  the article proposes an analytic decomposition of regimes into four main elements that give them autonomy and relevance  normativity  actors  specificity of the issue area and complex interdependence as context
