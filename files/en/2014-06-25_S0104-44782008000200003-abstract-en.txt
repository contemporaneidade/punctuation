The firm is a hybrid object set at the crossroads of several disciplines such as Management Sciences  Economics  Sociology and Psychology  Although the firm has also become the object of a considerable amount of research  we are still lacking a solid base of knowledge on its regulation modes  The discovery that the firm is not reducible to the notion of an organization founded on power relations among actors but can be considered a space of socialization has enabled us to introduce frameworks of cultural regulation  Our analytical perspective views its productive context as emerging from a socio historical fabric as well as the contingencies of external milieu  The autonomy of the firm can be understood from the perspective of the singularity of its developmental trajectory  never reducible to its formal structure or market contingencies  The Sociology of the Firm furthers our knowledge of social systems of production through an analysis of middle levels of regulation  that is  production establishments  This article proposes a general typology of the social modes of firm functioning  combining the social and administrative dimensions of organizations  development strategies  human resource and organizational politics as well as systems for cooperation between actors and cultural professionals
