In this article  I comment on some difficulties related to the building up of knowledge on human trafficking  I base myself on research experience carried out in Brazil and in Spain which shows the importance of mapping and locating the notions of the different interest groups involved  including those people whom it is expected to protect and help  I analyze methodological problems  discussing the effects of the validity of the different definitions of human trafficking in the production of data and documents  In conclusion  I take into consideration the distinctions between crime and the violation of human rights so as to reflect on one of the aspects present in the material  the distance between the perception of tose technically considered to be victims of trafficking and the legal definitions of this crime
