The relationship established between Joaquim Nabuco and the British and Foreign Anti slavery Society  currently named Anti Slavery International  is a little studied aspect of the struggle to abolish slavery in Brazil  The correspondence between Nabuco and Charles Harris Allen  Secretary of the Society  and other British abolitionists throughout the decade of the1880s and beyond reveals a partnership consciously sought by Nabuco with the aim of internationalizing the struggle These letters provide a unique insight into the evolution of Nabuco s thinking on both slavery and abolition  the difficulties he faced  including the accusation of lack of patriotism  and the powerful support he found in London  At the same time they offer a running commentary on the slow and  at least until 1887 8  uncertain progress of the abolitionist cause in Brazil
