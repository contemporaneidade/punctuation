The objective of this article is to compare the performance of the political systems in Brazil and Spain  In both countries the redemocratization process occurred by way of negotiation with the leaders of the out going authoritarian regimes  The hypothesis emerging from these two experiences is that this transition format limited the range of possible institutional choices  An analysis of three fundamental dimensions in these choices  the electoral and party systems in each country  the systems of government that were adopted  and the internal organization of the respective Legislative Branches indicates that the history of transition fostered a concentration of decision making power in the hands of the Administration and the party leadership  Thus  despite important differences in the Constitutional dimension of the respective political systems  Brazil and Spain shaped similar procedural rules that have led to a huge public policy making advantage for the Administration
