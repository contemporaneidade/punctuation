This article discusses the presence of the Federal Supreme Court  Supremo Tribunal Federal  STF  on the national public scene during the process of  political opening  and the consolidation of democracy in Brazil  from 1979 to 1999  We seek an understanding the relations between the Court and the State  society and politics  through the way in which the STF was perceived by several vehicles of public opinion formation  We use two daily S o Paulo newspapers  the Folha de S o Paulo and O Estado de S o Paulo  as our parameters  These newspapers serve as a  thermometer  for the presence and action of the Court as actor within the national political scenario  We come to the conclusion that the Court sought to change the image that public opinion held of it  moving from a situation in which it was identified as estranged from the country s needs and realities to the image of an institution of central importance for the nation s development
