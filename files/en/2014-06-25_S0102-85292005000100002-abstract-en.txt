This article demonstrates that there is not one international regime theory  but a set of theoretical and empirical studies that  alone or together  do not constitute a  general theory  of International Relations  Three approaches summarise the main debates on regimes  structural realism  neoliberalism  and cognitivism  The first perspective   the realist   considers power as the main concept for explaining international regimes  Neoliberalism considers interest as the main analytical tool to understand the creation and maintenance of regimes  Finally  cognitivism places ideas and values at the center of its explanations  After establishing these perspectives  the pharmaceutical patents dispute between Brazil and the United States  1988 2001  is analyzed  utilizing insights gained by the study of international regimes   privileging the neoliberal approach  From this conflict between Brazil and the United States  some strategies are also outlined that can be used by developing countries to maximize their gains on the international stage
