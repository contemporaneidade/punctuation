This article explores a critical link between two concepts which are central to the social sciences  the idea of liminarity  engendered by the anthropological tradition of self centred and self referred monographic studies  and the idea of individuality  a key concept within the classical tradition of the socio historical studies of great civilizations  as well as being the crucial and familiar category of our civil and political universe  The author seeks to show how a bridge can be established between these two concepts  which may at first appear distant  by focusing on certain under discussed aspects of rites of passage  It is argued that the  liminal  stage of rites of passage is tied to the ambiguity brought about through the isolation and individualization of the initiate  It is therefore the experience of being  outside the world  which brings about and characterises liminal states  and not the other way around   in short  it is individuality which engenders liminarity  Rites of passage transform this experience into complimentarity  into an immersion into a network of social relationships  which the ordeals  in contrast  establish as a model for the plenitude of social life
