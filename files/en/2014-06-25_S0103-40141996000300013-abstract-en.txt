Starting from a panoramic reading of the New World Order and from an analysis of the status quo in the light of theories of Social Psychology  in this article is developed a critical view of the antecipation of a neoliberal future  interpreting it as the result of propaganda by systematic forces over the social representations created from history  Inspired by the ideas of Marramao  Wallerstein  Balducci  Habermas  Enriquez and Money Kyrle  it argues  differently  for the need to create a planetary man  one capable of establishing relationships based on an ethics of the interdependency of groups and not on competition  In order to achieve that  it proposes the strategy of expanding the social organization of zones of widening speech and the promotion of networks of inter cultural dialog  as a form of construction of a new humanism
