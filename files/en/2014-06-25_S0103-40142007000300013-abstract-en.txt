This article discusses the failure of the current policy for the so called  illicit drugs  There is more taboo based on sanitary and medical assumptions mixed with moral precepts and prejudices about the danger of drug addiction than real knowledge and efficient actions  Evidences show that treating drug intake and drug trade as a police case  as a crime  or even as a conduct that is decriminalized by the consumer whereas the drug dealers are overpenalized  stigmatized and considered demoniac persons do not contribute to reduce consumption nor to create a world free of drugs  as desired by the United Nations  The  war on drugs  led by the United States of America  besides wasting great amounts of public money and thousands of human lives year after year  does not take the human dignity into account  Rationality is absent and the legitimacy of such policy is damaged in view of authority crises  repression generated violence  corruption and overcrowded prisons  These are menaces to the Democratic State of Law and we fear that the Brazilian State will repeat the tragedy of Canudos if the Army enters the war on drugs
