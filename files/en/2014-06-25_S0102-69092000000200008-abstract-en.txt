The article tries to show that mass media communication constitutes mechanisms of power that exert a fundamental function on the historical resistance of political conservatism in Brazil  The specific contribution of this work is the formulation of a methodology based on the discourse theory   post structuralist theory of communication and deconstruction   that contrasts political strategies in party manifestos and party broadcasts on television  Through this methodology  the author presents evidence that political mobilisation depends on a type of secondary or connotative discourse  Based on the theoretical approach of Derrida and Laclau discourse theory  the author develops the proposition that the electronic media contributes to a non adversarial dynamics in the Brazilian politics through the weakening of clear cut political frontiers
