This article discusses how middle and upper middle class Brazilian women deal with their exoticized images in Los Angeles  It points out that although originally articulated from Hollywood  Carmen Miranda  within the limits of the hierarchy of nations and colonialism  today these images are also fed and recreated by Brazilians  One of the central ideas presented is that  despite constraining the movements and actions of the women  imposing on them the need to dialogue with their content  these exotic images do not do it permanently  In other words  in the process of integration  there is always room for negotiation of other images and contents that depend on factor other than exoticization itself
