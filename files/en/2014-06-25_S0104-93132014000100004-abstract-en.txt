The article reflects on property and wellbeing among the Xikrin meb ng kre  Kayap  Indians  It argues that these notions must be articulated with a wider problem in Indigenous philosophy and existence  differentiation  It proposes that one of the definitions of well being in the Meb ng kre social world is the maintenance  in all levels  of a certain coefficient of difference  Difference  in turn  is linked to the notion of property  particularly ceremonial property  since the ritual system is a basic  collective mechanism of differentiation  The establishment of a totemic type system of dividing property served to avoid crises of indifferentiation  thereby ensuring well being  It is suggested that the Meb ng kre ritual system underwent important historical changes that have shifted a totemic type differentiation towards a hierarchical type differentiation  within which rivalries can emerge both in the heart of communities and between them
