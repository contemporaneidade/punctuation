This paper shows how  from a Tocquevillean point of view  the American democracy  far from being a model is  in reality  a unique case  In spite of his erudition  the noble Norman knew very little about the political institutions of the Iberian world  Thus  to study the south of the American continent from a Tocquevillean inspired perspective  it is his method and not his empirical analysis that will be followed  The growing disbelief in democratic institutions in Iberian American countries  nowadays  brings up the need to study in depth the institutions that are rooted in our political and social tradition  It is quite probable that the mistrust is placed not in democracy itself but in some specific kind of variant of democracy which appears to the Iberian American population as alien to its destiny  In spite of the merciful wishes of some political scientists  when it comes to democracy  what is good for the United States is good only if it is for the United States
