Drawing on an ethnography of the author s childhood village in southwestern France  this article analyses the social uses and meaning of photographs and photographic practice in the peasant society of B arn in the early 1960s  Photography was first introduced on the occasion of the great ceremonies of familial and collective life  such as weddings  in which it fulfills the function of affirming the unity  standing  and boundaries of the lineages involved  Such ceremonies can be photographed because they lie outside the everyday routine and they must be photographed to solemnize and materialize the image that the group intends to present of itself  Thus photos are read and appreciated not in themselves and for themselves  in terms of their technical or aesthetic qualities  but as lay sociograms providing a visual record of extant social roles and relations
