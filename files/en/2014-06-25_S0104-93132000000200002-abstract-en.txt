This article is concerned with the ritualization of sexual antagonism in Amazonia through an analysis of ethnographic data from the Matis  a Panoan speaking group  More specifically  it analyzes the small repertoire of sounds and shouts which men and women use in certain ritual contexts  arguing that they form a system which should be interpreted in light of the sexual complementarity and generalized transformability which is characteristic of Ame  rindian cosmologies  Finally  it hopes to contribute to the recently revisited debates among Americanists and Ocea nists  who find in flute complexes  masks and the cults with which they are associated  a common theme
