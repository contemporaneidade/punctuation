This article  fruit of ongoing research  engages in a type of analysis that has to a large extent been neglected in Brazil  Reaffirming ties to a rich tradition of Brazilian Sociology and Political Science   a tradition that came into being in the 1960s and 1970s   the author attempts to examine the interests of fractions of the Brazilian bourgeoisie that come to act as distinct segments within the national political process and the relations that these interests maintain with the politics of the State  Conflicts between these fractions of the bourgeoisie and the relations that  as bourgeois fractions in a dependent country  the former develop with imperialism and with popular classes are also examined  In an approach that is always tentative and only a beginning  the article also makes reference to the shift in the bourgeois hierarchy of power  that is  the shift that occurred within the block in power during the two presidential mandates of Luis Ign cio Lula da Silva  We offer the hypothesis that dependent Brazilian capitalism s new position within internationalization did not impede the action and improved position of a powerful sector of the large bourgeoisie of this country within the block in power  a situation that developed over the first decade of the 2000s
