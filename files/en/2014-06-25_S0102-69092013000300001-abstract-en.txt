The autonomization of the literary field is not only the fruit of a reaction against the market  as analyzed by Bourdieu  It is brought about as well against the moral and political expectations influencing literature  Those expectations are codified in the laws through the penal responsibility of the author  which  according to Michel Foucault  is consubstantial to the emergence of the modern figure of the author  The analysis of the literary processes discloses also what is at stake in the struggle around the definition of the writer s responsibility  Admitting a double dimension subjective and objective  this responsibility is set up not only in relation to the contents of the writings  but also in what concerns their form  their support  their target public  their assumptions related to the social effects of the literature and the social responsibility attributed to the writer  It is in close relation with  and largely against  the penal definition of the responsibility that the writers have built an autonomous professional ethics  which gave place to two opposed postures  that of the art by the art  personified by Flaubert  and that of the engagement  illustrated by Zola and  ulteriorly  by Sartre
