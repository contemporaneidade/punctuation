This paper discusses the theoretical foundations for using case studies in comparative political science  It makes the claim about the continuous demand for using case study research designs  This argument is built upon three major claims for validation of this approach  the equifinality  process tracing  and the explanation by mechanisms  Based on these assumptions  a new generation of researchers in qualitative political science points out that case study methodology continues to be relevant for  enlarging the connection between theory and evidence  the development of explanations and causal inferences in comparative politics  and  for theory construction
