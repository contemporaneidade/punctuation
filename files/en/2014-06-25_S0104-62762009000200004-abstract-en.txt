This paper examines the incidence of liberal and  illiberal  democracy in Latin America from 1978 through 2004  It demonstrates  first  that illiberal democracy   which combines free and fair elections with systematic constraints on civil liberties   has become the norm throughout the region  Second  it shows that regime transitions have most often ended not in liberal democracy  but in illiberal democracy  Third  rare events logit analysis reveals that three variables   hyperinflation  general strikes  and presidential elections   have had significant impact on transitions toward fuller democracy  As a form of short term economic shock  hyperinflation generates widespread discontent which sometimes results in general strikes  given the opportunity to vote  citizens elect reformist opposition candidates who  once in office  remove controls on civil liberties  This scenario substantially increases the likelihood of transition from illiberal to liberal democracy
