This paper examines some paradoxes experienced by evangelical military police actions active members of congregations located in the barracks of the State of Rio de Janeiro Military Police  in Portuguese  PMERJ  in the search for dialogue between their faith  the prerogatives of their mission and the values that inform the dominant police practice  The study is based on the concept of  techniques of neutralization  of  Sykes and Matza  1996  as well as the typology of Muir Jr   1977  on police responses of the so called  paradoxes of coercion  The analysis shows that the Manicheist rhetoric of  spiritual warfare  is transposed to the police environment and vigorously appropriated to the experience of coercion in police practices  This result seems to show the construction of evangelical ethical standards for police action  in which daily conflicts are conducted as visible expressions of the nefarious influence of the demon  responsible for crime  debauchery and all sorts of socially disapproved behaviors
