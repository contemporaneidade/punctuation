This article begins with the observation of two current phenomena  demographic change and the critical pattern of income distribution in Brazil  It s principal argument concerns the question of strengthening the relationship between the State and civil society in a context where globalization comes to impose distinct political directives on the treatment of the social problem  In dealing with the social and territorial integration question  which is strongly characterized by social exclusion  the basic thesis is that the social dimension must be introduced into the country s set of macro politics  especially those related to stabilization  As long as treatment of the question is limited to only compensatory policies  there will be room for false arguments regarding means and ends  and resulting high inefficiency costs  The paper presents some ways of moving towards democratic construction which involve the relationship between State and society  As an alternative to the competitive entry project presently underway  it proposes economic overture based on a national project in which public actions are democratically defined  This implies the elimination of the elite s privileges and the opening of effective channels with the organized social movement which would permit publicization and a rupture to State omnipotence
