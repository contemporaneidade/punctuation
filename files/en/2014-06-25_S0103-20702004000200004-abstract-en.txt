Received in the 90s as an important renewal of the social sciences  reflexive modernity sociology  developed specially by A  Giddens and U  Beck  already shows evident signs of weakness  From a theoretical point of view  this approach is unable to avoid the evolutionism found within the first modernization sociology  If in the later it were the institutions and social structures of the North Atlantic societies that represented History s end of the line  yet to be achieved by all the other societies  reflexive modernization theory establishes reflexive subjectivity as a reference to its teleology  On the other hand  the conception of a  third way  beyond the left and right wings  is upheld by an idealized view of politics  which puts this sphere above power relations and interests  Therefore  reflexive modernization is deprived of any analytical resource capable of favoring a critical understanding of the recent developments in world politics
