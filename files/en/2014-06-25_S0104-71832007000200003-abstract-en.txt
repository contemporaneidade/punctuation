This article is aimed to consider the consequences of viewing consumption through the lens of contemporary material culture studies  It starts by acknowledging the reasons consumption is often seen as the destruction of material culture and therefore intrinsically evil  It then explores various disciplinary approaches to consumption such as history and sociology before concentrating on anthropology and various regional perspectives  It then explores more specific approaches from material culture studies  first theoretically  and then substantively in terms of four genres of home  clothing the media and the car  Two broader concerns follow  that of commodity chain analysis and the general relationship between persons and things  It concludes that so far from promoting materialism  a material culture perspective emphasis how consumption can be used to understand our humanity
