The principal aim of this paper is to provide a intuitive introduction to cluster analysis  Methodologically  we use data from Coppedge  Alvarez e Maldonado  2008  regarding the two dimensions of polyarchy proposed by Dahl  1971  contestation and inclusiveness  Based on these dimensions we classify political regimes in different groups  clusters  according to their similarity level  On substantive grounds  we hope to suggest a methodological tool to classify political regimes and facilitate the understanding of cluster analysis in Political Science
