This article aims to present how  while using different architectural languages  two architectural fictions stage the same identity  The two cases studied are from Rio Grande do Sul  South Brazil  the area of Venetian immigration at the end of the XIX century  Today  the third generation of the descendants of Venetian immigrants is living what Anthony D  Smith calls the  ethnic revival  They are reinventing their Northern Italian identity not only by using an identity check list   search for great heroes and famous ancestors  a language  a folklore  etc  but also by playing this identity by architectural means in order to build up a cultural heritage  Through the examination observation of some architectures  I will show how the usage and the invention of signs are able to build this  identity fiction
