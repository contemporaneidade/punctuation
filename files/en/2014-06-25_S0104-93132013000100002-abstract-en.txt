The present article analyses police records for missing persons that were registered and filed in police stations of Rio de Janeiro from 2005 to 2009  It argues that these documents are not only material traces of the facts therein registered  but also the driving forces for two main processes through which missing persons cases are managed  The first process is a statement of position towards the cases constructed by police officers out of the opposing pair  a family problem  and  a police problem  The second process  which makes sense within the framework of the first  is the delegation of responsibilities to the missing persons families  who ultimately manage and even solve the cases by means of commitments  obligations and affection
