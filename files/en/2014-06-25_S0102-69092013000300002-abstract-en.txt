The text is a transcription of Pierre Bourdieu s speech by occasion of the reception of the Gold Medal awarded by the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique  CNRS  the most important scientific distinction in France  Bourdieu develops here a discourse in praise of sociology  discussing its status as science  always subjected to controversy  According to Bourdieu  In order to be effectively an autonomous and cumulative form of knowledge  sociology must be necessarily reflexive  taking itself as an object and employing the instruments of knowledge in view of revealing the social effects generated by its own production  Hence  the importance of sociology for the understanding of the other sciences  for it draws forth the repressed unconscious in the social logic of any scientific knowledge  In analyzing the social mechanisms that govern the functioning of the world of science  sociologists and historians can contribute to a collective control able to confront the arrogance of scientism  Without succumbing to prophetic pretensions  the sociologist has the right to claim for the function exerted by the other scientists  in the sense of giving precise and verifiable answers in the restraint domains in which he works  But he should not assume the role of an expert at the service of the powers  On the contrary  according to Bourdieu  sociology should always be a critical counter power  in opposition to the powers based on sciences  real or supposed   in order to carry out its existence or legitimize it
