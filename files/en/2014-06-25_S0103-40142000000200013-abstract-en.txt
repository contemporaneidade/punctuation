IN THIS paper  one attempts to develop a method for investigating counterfactual histories of science  that is  possibles histories that did not occur  We develop a theory of science based on the notion of  advance   ideas  data etc  which are units passed from scientist to scientist and which would be conserved in passing from one possible history to another  Advances are connected to each other by nets of causal influence  and we distinguish strong and weak influences  Around sixty types of advances are grouped in ten classes  As our case study  we examine the beginning of the Old Quantum Theory  1850 1915  using computation to store and process historical information  Based only on secondary literature  we describe four great possible histories and six small paths to the appearance of this theory  As continuation of the research  we will have to examine in greater detail the history of the period  especially of experimental science  and improve the strategies for postulation of counterfactual histories
