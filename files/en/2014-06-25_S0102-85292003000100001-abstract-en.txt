This article discusses the legacy and limits of the Kantian paradigm in international relations  Contemporary Kantian reconstructions in international relations emphasise the positive aspects of liberal and institutional ideas  although they restrict themselves to the analysis of principles  and do not analyse what impedes the realisation of these principles  The first part of the paper analyses juridical principles that Kant established as conditions for peace  1  Pacification of international order depends on democratisation of internal order  2  Relations between states must be subject to international law  3  Individuals must be considered as world citizens  according to cosmopolitan law  The second part shows how these principles have defined and oriented the pacifist movement as well as so called  utopian idealism  in the between wars period  Further  it analyses realist criticism of those principles in post war periods  according to which  1  Democracy in internal order does not influence peace in international order  2  Peace in international relations can be assured not by international law  but by military alliances  3  Cosmopolitan ideals  moralise  international relations  transforming political conflict into a contention between  good  and  evil  Finally  it investigates how contemporary analyses orient themselves to Kantian principles  as opposed to realism  reason of state  This shows that this paradigm  while necessary  is not sufficient for analyses of international relations  since it does not consider the affirmation of principles in the analyses of hegemonic relations that characterize the international scene
