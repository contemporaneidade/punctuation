PARECIS Plateau in the State of Mato Grosso has been submitted to an intense process of occupation for the last thirty years  Through this work a temporal analysis is done on the borders of Nambikwara and Enawene Naw  which are two of several other indian reservations that are distributed over the Parecis Plateau  The study analyses the spatial distribution of the reservation boundaries and the expanding nearer cropfields  TM LANDSAT images collected in June of 1984 and May June of 1997 are the main data support  The general procedures included  digitizing the reservation bounds  conforming cartographic bases and projections  registering images and maps  linear model of spectral mixture  analysis  Results show that the reservation boundaries are getting closer and are often trespassed by cropfields bounds  Trespassed boundaries were depicted in the northwestern edge of Enawene Naw  along the route that links Vilhena to Ju na  route MT 319  The spatial distribution of the roads in the region showed that the vicinals were the main vectors of the process that need to be continuously observed  The results allow recommending the application of the same procedures elsewhere in the country  The experience also allows anticipating that the same methodology can be used even for reservations poorly known or known just by preliminary surveys or descriptive memorials
