Brazilian redemocratization has profoundly transformed the relations between State and society and the marriage between democracy and representation  The changes were not restricted to electoral and state representation  but reached civil society s spheres of action  The direct incorporation of citizens into policymaking processes is one of the most significant innovations of democratization in Brazil  This article argues that the new institutional architecture that expands the connections between State and society inaugurates a new moment of political representation in the country  Here  social actors represent along with government agents the interests of society in relation to certain types of public policy  without being incorporated by the state  and vice versa  In order to understand the democratizing potentials of these transformations  this paper proposes  based on international debates  a reinterpretation of the concept of political representation  as well as its criteria of legitimacy  namely  accountability and responsiveness  In addition  the paper highlights the specificities of representation in Brazilian participatory institutions  It argues that its institutional placement and intersection with state and societal arenas are characteristics that influence the practice of accountability and responsiveness
