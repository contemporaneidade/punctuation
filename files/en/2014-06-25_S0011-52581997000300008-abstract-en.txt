A prominent question in recent comparative work is  when will the personal vote matter  Typically  scholars approach this question at a cross national as opposed to a cross party level  that is  they highlight features of national electoral systems that create incentives for individual politicians to pursue a personal  or a party  vote  rather than highlighting features of parties that might predispose candidates in those parties to pursue personal  or party  votes  Implicitly  the electoral systems comparisons hold constant party features  In this paper  in contrast  I focus on the characteristics of parties  as opposed to the characteristics of electoral systems  as determinants of personal vote seeking  I argue that adoption of an individualistic or collective strategy depends largely on a party s access to and control over funding and patronage  generally  parties with good access to money and pork should adopt individualistic strategies  while parties with poor access to money and pork should adopt more collective strategies  In this paper  I explore the Brazilian case to test this claim  I test my claims at the national and district level  using multiple regression analysis  Furthermore  I explain how one party  the Workers  Party  PT  has overcome the incentives of the electoral system over the long run
