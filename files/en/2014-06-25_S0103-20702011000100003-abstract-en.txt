This article is a contribution to the contemporary genealogy of what has become known as dirty work  More specifically it is a commentary on the notion of  evil work  developed conjointly by Christophe Dejours and Joseph Torrente through a historical view of the Holocaust based on the discovery of the collective experience of  atrocious work  as a key to explaining the destruction of the Jews in Europe  In sum  the revelation of how the horror of the Third Reich derives from the imposition of genocide as mass work undertaken by a legion of zealous collaborators  A hypothesis until then dormant in even the best historiography that needed to wait for the intensification of social suffering through the dirty work of today s neoliberalism for it to awaken finally and suggest this explosive short circuit in a true diagnosis of an era
