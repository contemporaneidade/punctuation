This paper deals with the relationship between recognition and subjugation as approached in the negative and positive theories of recognition  A common starting point of these theories is the perception of the relational character of our identity and the interpretation of this dependency relation as a productive and constitutive event  In my argumentative strategy  I will proceed in an  inward  manner  I will take seriously the fact that  in both cases  theories of intersubjectivity are treated to assess whether or not they do justice to the original perception that consciousness of myself I only acquire as mediated by another self  The two positions share the conception that there is no pre social self and  thus  also share the view that individuality and sociality are mutually conditioning  They  nevertheless  differ as to how they interpret and evaluate this condition
