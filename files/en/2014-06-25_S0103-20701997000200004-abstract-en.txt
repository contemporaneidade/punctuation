The article analyzes the film Clockwork Orange by Stanley Kubrick  made in 1971  In opposition to the traditional analyses which try to see this film as a libel against violence   or curiously  an apology for this same violence   the purpose here is to give an interpretation which follows the visual fundaments that render the spectator this perception of  violence  emphasizing there mainly the values put into evidence by the images the film shows us  Consequently an analytical redirectioning of well watched and discussed film is suggested  and other fundamental elements are brought to light as well as the manner by which these elements are exposed to the audience  in order to build up a new dimension of unexpected meanings
