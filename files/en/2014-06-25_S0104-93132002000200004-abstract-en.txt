This essay examines various aspects of the sociocosmology of the Ikpeng  an Amerindian people of southern Amazonia  Through an attempted absorption of various Ikpeng concepts into its analytic vocabulary  it explores the convergence of the notions of affect  not relation  and becoming  not transformation  of this people on a sociopolitical plane composed by a mixture of peoples and species  not persons  On this plane  the shaman figures as a species anomaly  a position achieved via his exposure to multiple deaths  a radicalized version of the self intoxication experienced throughout a subject s lifetime  Sustained by an animistic shamanic cosmology  these conceptions prove incompatible with the humanistic models of sociopolitics predominant in contemporary anthropology  Following this indigenous line of thinking also exposes a non organic modelling of sexual difference  intrinsic to the trans species compositions involved in Ikpeng rituals  but whose first points of emergence are the shamanic initiation of boys and the menstruation of girls
