This article analyzes the relationship between youth and contemporary politics  Its principal focus of discussion refers to the process of political subjectivation and deals initially with the question of how this process implies the building of a sense of belonging to a collectivity and being responsible for life in common  as major aspects of the process of assuming one s connection to society which suggest modes of participation and action  Possibilities for engagement and their political meaning are discussed in light of youth s apparent inertia and apathy with regard to politics  A qualitative empirical study with approximately 25 youth is presented  based on interviews carried out with youth activists in student organizations and in political parties  as well as youth engaged in volunteer social work  In our analysis  there is evidence of convergence and divergence between the two groups in the meaning and objectives of engaged action and in conventional forms of militance  we discuss the relationship between these youths  trajectories and  causes  they take up that propell their action and social participation  This brings out a distinction between  politics  and  the political  keeping in mind that institutionalized forms of political activity no longer seem to allow us to deal with the demands of a shared existence  while at the same time  new forms of political action may take on the characteristics of isolated acts  Thus we conclude that for the young people we have interviewed  forms of participation and social engagement follow different paths  whether those of institutional politics  political activism or volunteer social work
