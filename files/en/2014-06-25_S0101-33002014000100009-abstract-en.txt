Slavoj  381 i 382 ek proposes to offer a renewed version of dialectical materialism and so a critical theory of late modern capitalism  The path through German Idealism is the path he has chosen and it is important to know if his version is leading us correctly  The article suggests a different way of understanding the problem of  negativity  in that tradition  This forces the question of whether there is much left in contemporary society that provides any sort of material basis for Hegel s aspirations about the potentially transformative and educative potentials of modern civil society  No one can be anything but profoundly pessimistic about this possibility  but the search for such possible  traces of reason  seems to be more genuinely Hegelian
