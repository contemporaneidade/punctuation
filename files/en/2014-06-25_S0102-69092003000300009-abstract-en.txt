This paper explores the basis for a conceptual formulation on the role of human rights in democratic politics  having the changes in the 1990 s as starting point  The human rights can t be restricted to the constitutional scope  In other words  the analysis of the human rights based on an analogy with the constitutional rights is well suited to criticism  On the one hand  the pyramidal model of Rights supposed by such analogy has been subject to theoretical and practical questioning in the past few years  On the other hand  the human rights have a much greater role due to their international nature and the way they are inserted in the democratic politic dynamics
