The relations among communication  mass media and local democracy are analysed here from an empirical case of the Belo Horizonte s Prefecture  In May 2003 the Prefecture started a publicity campaign entitled Who likes BH  has one s own way to show it  Quem gosta de BH tem seu jeito de mostrar  Two distinct assumptions arise from an ideal image of political participation that guides the campaign  In one hand the campaign claims for a division of tasks among citizens that would improve the life qualityin the city  In the other hand it imposes a restriction to political participation by giving to citizens the false status of collaborators in solving colctive problems  The strategic use of mass media creates a sensation of proximity between municipal government and citizens while a real deliberation process does not take place among the inhabitants  The campaign policy discourse assigns specific actors and actions  underlining their contributions to collective good as a path to generate internal political and cultural cohesion within the city
