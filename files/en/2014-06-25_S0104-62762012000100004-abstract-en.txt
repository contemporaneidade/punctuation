This paper analyses some of the critics that were directed to the theories of deliberative democracy  in order to rescue the idea of conflict as a crucial component for the development of contemporary democracies  These theories have contributed to a theoretical breakthrough on the issues of political inclusion  recognizing the importance of political autonomy and expansion of formal equality  Despite these advances  theories of deliberative democracy have become the object of criticism in the last decade  due to the excessive emphasis on consensus  which eventually eclipsed other forms of political action  such as contentious politics  In this paper I attempt to reinforce the idea of conflict as a decisive element for the development of our democracies  In this sense  I promote a dialogue between the theories of deliberative democracy and the theory of political processes  which has as it s central focus the analysis of the relationship among collective actors  contentious politics and the political context
