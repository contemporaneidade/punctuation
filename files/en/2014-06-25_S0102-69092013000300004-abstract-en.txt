The attempt to overcome the subjectivism objectivism dichotomy is at the root of Bourdieu s praxeological perspective  whose core is the dialectical relation between individual conducts that are subjectively propelled by dispositions integrated into a habitus  on the one hand  and objective structures or  fields  of relations between differentially positioned and empowered agents  on the other  However  this approach has been portrayed by critics as a sophisticated version of neo objectivism  rather than a satisfactorily synthetic theory of the agency structure relationship  The article evaluates this critique  defending that the main source of neo objectivism in Bourdieu s oeuvre stems from his valuable  but unilateral  emphasis on the tacit or  pre reflexive  character of the operation of the habitus  which leads him to a theorization that neglects the agentic significance of the actor s reflexive consciousness  Finally  based on this diagnosis  the paper delineates some theoretical paths through which Bourdieu s analytical scheme may be inflected towards a more genuinely dialectical treatment of the causal interdependence between individual actions and social structures
