The Regional Question  which in Brazil traditionally refers to the Northeast  developed originally in the nineteenth century as a result of the manner in which economic expansion  namely capitalist coffee agriculture in southeastern Brazil  resolved the issue of land and labor markets  After having eliminating its competitors  either through the use of force  suppression of regional revolts  or through fiscal incentives for their own private benefit  the coffee growing bourgeoisie of S o Paulo State proved incapable of exercising hegemony effectively  During the 1940s and 50s  the last chance of mending a fractured process and resolving the Regional Question were wasted  as this was a period when S o Paulo not only concentrated industrial power but also constituted the nation s principal hope  New social and political forces  which have matured in a complex fashion over the last two decades  have become the main actors most capable of recovering the country and the Nation in terms of modernity  though they inherit an incomplete hegemony that has left a long line of disasters in its wake  which are precisely what must be undone  An analysis of the Regional Question  rather than simply a northeastern plaidoyer  may provide the key to understanding such an inheritance
