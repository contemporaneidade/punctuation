This article discusses the concept of life world  relating it to the hypothesis of symbolic mobility flowing from analysis of reception and discussion of the television series  City of Men   Cidade dos Homens  Rede Globo  2002  carried out through focal groups with youth  slum dwellers and non slum dwellers in Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro  We not only consider focal groups as a qualitative research methodology  but as a form of mediation that is capable of stimulating the production of meaning in situations of collective reception  fomenting processes in which representations are questioned and identities are formed and sustained  It is our hypothesis that although representations exhibited by communications media tend to reproduce stereotypes  we can still identify a relative plurality and identify productions that possess an explicit intention to alter such stereotypes  In this regard  communications media provide an important mediation whose ability to filter   mediatize  and emphasize certain topics offers perspectives  molds images and incites the creation of political and social contexts of debate and interaction  Given the significant presence of communications media in social life  our proposal is to show how televsion and its messages  which play such a fundamental role in cristalizing a stock of knowledge  may also contribute to problematizing and dislocating previously formulated understandings
