This text discusses the forms of selection of information and production of news stories  For its authors  the central question in this respect is what it means to say that news reports are true  In other words  what are the criteria and values corresponding to stories seen as true  The analysis is part of the wider discussion on the relationships of values to facts in journalism  Objectivity is seen as a device to legitimate some discourses and allows for the presentation of opinions as facts  It results from negotiations about the values that are the assumptions of opinions  Moral standards that are at the foundations of news productions become facts that may  then  be reported with exemption
