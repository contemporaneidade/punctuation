A crucial issue in international relations is to associate theoretical with historical inquiry  This paper aims to analyse how Hobbes struggled with this problem  in which measure his answers have influenced the theory of international relations and to what extent they permit the solution of contemporary problems in this discipline  The first part analyses how Hobbes justifies his method of thinking both historically and theoretically  The second part shows how Hobbes is later rehabilitated by the revision of idealism as well as by the emergence of the doctrine known as realism  in both cases with the aim of criticising early idealism  The third part  considering the contemporary debate in international relations  analyses how neo realism  investigating above all power technologies  loses the interest for historical inquiry that was present in classical realism  and how normativism  which came to prominence in the 90s  formulating a justified criticism of the lack of ethical reflection by neo realism  often creates variants of utopian idealism  In both there is a lack of historical inquiry  which does not allow the analysis of the contingency of social relations  If the predominantly anthropological character of Hobbes  historiography  as well as the predominantly institutionalistic character of his state and law theory can no longer be accepted  it is his way of thinking theoretically and historically at once which is the challenge and the legacy that he has left to us
