A strong distance was maintained by traditional social movements that  despite the intense circulation of ideas through the whole Rio 1992 UNCED process  lacked confidence towards environmental discourse  In 2001 this distance began to be reduced  after the creation of the Brazilian Network of Environmental Justice  The present text describes the steps towards this Network creation  as well as the observed specific process of local re appropriation of international experience  mainly that of the US environmental justice movement  It is discussed here how this process was characterized by an effort of reframing both the environmental justice dissociation felt currently in the Brazilian experience and the American environmental justice concept  as it was originally built on the US black movement experience
