Faced with the risk of a nuclear conflict between Pakistan and India  the Western powers have tried to exert a measure of control upon events in South Asia  they urged those two countries to start bilateral negotiations  promoted non proliferation  and from time to time applied sanctions  Pakistan is very sensitive to Western policies  above all those of the United States  but it never gave up two fundamental criteria of its foreign policy  the demand of self determination for Kashmir and nuclear deterrence  The United States now shows unmatched power and influence  but after the Iraqi crisis the unity of the great powers became shaky  At the same time the return to a civilian and parliamentarian regime in Pakistan added strength to the nationalist and Islamic parties  which want to contain United States influence and favour increased links with France  Germany  Russia  and China  In this new  fluid political environment  the evolution of Indian Pakistani relations will have a strong impact on Western strategies for South Asia and for the world at large
