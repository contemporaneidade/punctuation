Among the millions of Brazilians who currently live abroad  nearly 5 thousand play football at the world s top clubs  This article uses an anthropological perspective to analyze the migration of these Brazilian players with successful careers  seeking to understand the characteristics of this particular global circulation of people and money  which has enormous impact on the mediascape  Appadurai  1990  of all  exports  Of all Brazilian emigrations now underway  that of football players has the greatest symbolic impact  both in Brazil and abroad  Like the  brain drain  caused by the emigration of scientists  this is a case of  fleeting feet  I look at the plans  consumption and lifestyle of these players based on ethnographic data gathered in Seville  Spain and Eindhoven  Holland  and from discussions with more than 40 Brazilian players living or trying to live in foreign countries  The contacts were conducted in Toronto  Canada  Almelo  Groningen  Alkmaar  Rotterdam  and Amsterdam Holland  Tokyo  Japan  Lyon  Le Mans  Nancy and Lille France  Monaco  Charleroi  Belgium and in Fortaleza  Salvador and Belem  Brazil  I explore the intersections of age  social origin and religion and found that many of the players were the youngest siblings in their families  The large majority are poor and attend evangelical churches  I also found that these immigrant athletes are increasingly younger  I conclude that the constant exchange of employer  club or global club  of countries and the large number of  repatriots  characterize this migratory movement as a circulation  It is what the players call the  rotation  seen positively as an opportunity for experience  This circulation takes place in protected zones  where a banal nationalism  Billig  1995  is constantly activated  Even after obtaining legal citizenship  they continue to be seen and perceive themselves as foreigners  Nationalization thus has a strategic purpose  Sassen  2008  I conclude that they cross geographic borders without entering the countries  because their borders are the clubs and not the countries
