In analyzing J nio Quadros  political career  historians and social scientists pointed out that he acquired political strength as a national leader by proposing a rational and impersonal State administration  He would represent the antithesis of Get lio Vargas and Adhemar de Barros  whose political actions had a remarkable paternalistic content  This  however  does not seem to be entirely correct  Through letters he received between 1959 and 1960  when disputing the presidential elections  it is possible to observe that many of his supporters considered him a politician able to defend traditional social relations  Some invoked him to fight against speculators who stored goods in an inflationary scenario  while others treated him as a paternal figure by asking him money  jobs in the public administration and other sorts of favor  In this text  the author suggests that such demands could convey political manifestations and be expressions of citizenship
