This paper refers to three sets of fundamental issues which are still controversial and unsettled among social scientists  Two are basically conceptual or theoretical  one is both conceptual and empirical  First  what is globalization  How should it be conceptualized  Second  what kinds of inequality can be distinguished  and what are the most pertinent  Third  what kinds of processes produce the global outcomes of inequality that we are observing and experiencing  None of the three questions above has  and can be expected to get one straight answer  The aims of this paper are to conribute to a clarification of alternatives and their implications  to argue a certain conceptual analytical viewpoint  and to provide some empirical arguments for a multi faceted approach to the production of inequality in the world  Globalization and inequality are two crossroads of the social sciences and of social philosophy  This writer is reaching them from a background as a sociologist and as a political scientist
