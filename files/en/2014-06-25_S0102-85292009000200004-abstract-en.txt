This article discusses the possibilities of humanitarian intervention from the theoretical standpoint of the English School  Despite its recently emphasis on humanitarian intervention  the article shows the possibility of establishing a dialogue with Peace Studies and other theoretical approaches that discuss intervention in order to overcome the limitations of the English School   both ontological and epistemological   in this area due to the controversy over the existence or not of shared values by the international society  The article suggests that the limitations presented by the English School should be approached with a new understanding of the concept of  borders  By understanding borders as political zones where difference is preserved to guarantee international order  one may see borders as an ethical space of protection of difference  not only as a space of exclusion  In that fashion  and by using Hannah Arendt s ideals of diversity and tolerance  the article defends the acceptance of difference in international politics and the widening of the concept of intervention in the terms presented leading to a more politically conscious idea of humanitarian intervention
