This article analyses the transformations of the public space in the contemporary urban experience  presenting as an empirical reference the old Bairro do Recife  Recife Quarter  in Pernambuco  Brazil  The hypothesis of this work is concerned with everyday and public uses of these heritage spaces that could contribute to the qualification of certain urban spaces as public spaces  Therefore  the central argument of the article is that the uses and counter uses of gentrification spaces can constitute places  and that these places qualify urban spaces as public ones  insofar as they promote these space centers as practical and symbolic disputes for political acknowledgment and for the public visibility of differences
