This paper aims at outlining a concept of deliberation compatible with the theory of recognition  Despite fostering different bodies of knowledge  these two theoretical perspectives emphasize the emancipatory potential of intersubjective communication  In order to suggest a joint approach  the article challenges four questions that seem to indicate incompatibilities between recognition and deliberation  The paper advocates a deliberative approach marked by  1  a non altruist conception of reciprocity  2  a focus on meta consensus  3  a non cognitive understanding of communicative forms  4  a broad comprehension of deliberative processes  and 5  an understanding about the importance of civil society associations
