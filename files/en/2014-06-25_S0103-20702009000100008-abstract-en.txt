This paper attempts to analyze the convergences and divergences between the theoretical viewpoints of Habermas and Honneth  two of the most important social philosophers of the last few decades  Firstly  it compares their distinct methodological suppositions  relating them to the current debate over the contradiction between  moral  and  ethical  viewpoints  Next  it explores the idea that social struggles for recognition can form a theoretically productive medium for understanding the evolution of political institutions in the modern western world  Finally it examines the role played by the rule of law in modern societies  looking to determine to what point we can adhere to the Habermasian theory of discourse and where this can be usefully complemented by a theory of social recognition
