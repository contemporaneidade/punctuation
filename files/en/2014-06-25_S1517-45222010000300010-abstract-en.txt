Flexibility is a key word that summarizes the changes that resulted from the restructuring of the industry in the recent decades  The decrease in industrial employment  as well as its social and economic consequences  is the focus of the social criticism directed at projects based on the flexible pattern  which require more and more actions from the part of the companies to justify and legitimize this new facet of the production process  The AutoVision project of the multinational automobile manufacturer Volkswagen   implemented in two regions  Wolfsburg  in Germany  and the ABC Region in the state of S o Paulo  Brazil   presents the characteristics of a social intervention that comes with a more elaborate discourse of justification  The hypothesis to be tested is that the latest initiatives of globalized companies based on flexibility point to a political pre eminence in the formulation of proposals intended to mitigate the effects of the decrease in industrial employment  and to the construction of a rhetoric that endorses flexible employment  Theoretically  this case allows the discussion of different social arrangements based on flexibility  which are created by multinational companies  and the ways these companies justify their actions
