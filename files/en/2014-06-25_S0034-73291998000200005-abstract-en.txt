Economic integration  at both global and regional levels  calls for the redefinition and the reorientation of past practices on the part of social actors in general  and on the part of the trade union movement in particular  If States  international organizations and transnational corporations represent the main vectors of economic integration  other social forces do make themselves heard in new and original ways  The paper sets up a theoretical framework in order to understand and analyze these initiatives  After having briefly reviewed contributions by Leslie Sklair and Douglass C  North on this matter  the authors turn towards two issues  first  the international framework set up after World War II and past practices  second  the present terms of globalization as they affect the transnationalization of trade unions practices  This historical and theoretical presentation is illustrated with references to trade unions initiatives within the Americas  both in the North and in the South  as they have evolved in the wake of NAFTA  MERCOSUR and the FTAA
