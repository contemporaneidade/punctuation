The crisis of the Brazilian monarchical regime was accompanied by the emergence and expansion of the republican movement at the end of the 19th century  During that period  the press not only became the stage of institutional debates but also had the role of an informal power  linked to the government and political party organization  It was a press that expressed opinions and created a space for partisan commentary  Newspaper columns were used to anonymously air that which could not be expressed publicly in the Legislative Assembly  the Senate or the House of Representatives  thus constituting an alternative tribune for debate  This article seeks to give voice to the different republican models that circulated within these state of Paran  newspapers  relating them to the configurations they were a part of and with the position that they held within local and national fields of power  Furthermore  it is important to recognize that the dominant republican ideas were not disseminated without resistance  rather  they were heard and combated at the local level  although efforts in this regard remained lacking in political force  Our analysis incorporates the Bourdieusian perspective according to which discourses are not only signs to be understood and decoded but also status indicators  seeking to be validated and evaluated   and forms of authority  seeking to be believed and obeyed  in both cases  object of struggles over symbolic power  Analysis of republican discourse shows that Paran  state politics of the late 19th century was more a result of alliances and tensions between groups than the fruit of clear ideological stands  Discourses served mostly as rhetorical weapons which were used to orient intra elite conflict  moved by the desire for participation  This gave them a generic character  based on a notion of putting an end to privilege without widening citizenship rights
