This article is a direct reaction to Michael Burawoy s For Public Sociology  2005  It discusses the implications of that manifest in terms of a research practice that assimilates the dialogical component of the proposal and intends to present its limitations  which result from concessions both to professional sociology and policy sociology  These limitations are exposed based on some examples from fieldwork  in which the reflexive element of the research requires a problematization of the power relations between the interviewer and the interviewee  The article refers to Touraine s sociology of action and the methodology of sociological intervention to demonstrate that the tradition of the discipline has faced issues of that kind before  In the end  the article concludes for the relevance of  public sociology  but it takes into consideration the methodological incompatibilities with other  types  of sociology  characterized by the author in the above mentioned text
