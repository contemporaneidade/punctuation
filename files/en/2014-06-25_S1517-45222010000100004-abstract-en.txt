This paper identifies the concepts of ideology and discourse in the works of Marx and Foucault  respectively  It summarizes the Marxist analysis of the reversal of the laws of property as a consequence of the destruction of a specific ideology  and presents the archeology of the doctor patient relationship  from the work of Foucault  as an example of the configuration of a particular discursive field  To conclude  the paper points to a distanciation and a convergence between the concepts in question
