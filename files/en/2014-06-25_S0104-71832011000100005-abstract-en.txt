The outsourcing and offshoring of clinical trials have sparked an unprecedented field of experimental activity  This essay addresses the scientific and regulatory mechanisms by which a global field of experimentality takes form  It charts a clinical trials industry and its move to low  and middle income countries  particularly in Eastern Europe and Brazil  As the clinical trials enterprise adapts itself to international and national regulatory norms  the acknowledgement of adverse risks to patients and populations is often deferred or engineered out  The essay explores policy gaps with respect to how benefits and liabilities of this enterprise are weighed as well as emergent practices of accountability
