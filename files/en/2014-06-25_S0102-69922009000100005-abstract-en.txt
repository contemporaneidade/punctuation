The present paper discusses the approach given to social participation within strategic environmental assessment  SEA  methodologies  The research question for this paper arises from allegations made by SEA methodologies that they are more participatory and more connected to sustainability than the traditional environmental impact assessment  EIA  Three methodologies from different authors were selected   1  SEAN platform   2  the European Union Commission and  3  the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment  MMA  It was found that social participation was presented in all three methodologies  However  the aspect is treated differently concerning its position among the steps for the SEA and the relevance of participation inside the whole process  Indeed  the view of social participation within those methodologies is very restrictive and limited to community involvement  Also  conflicts are usually neglected by the methodologies  Finally  there are no innovative tools for implementing a new approach to social participation that might establish SEA as more participatory than EIA
