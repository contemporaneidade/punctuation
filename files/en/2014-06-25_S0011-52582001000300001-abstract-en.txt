This study examines the effects of globalization  democratization  and partisanship on social spending in 14 Latin American countries from 1973 to 1997  using a pooled time series error correction model  Weexamine three sets of issues  First  following debates in the literature on OECD countries  we want to know whether social spending has been encouraged or constrained by integration into global markets  Within this context  we examine the extent to which such outcomes might be influenced by two additional sets of domestic political and institutional factors discussed in work on developed countries  the electoral pressures of democratic institutions  and whether or not popularly based governments are in power  We show that trade integration has a consistently negative effect on aggregate social spending  and that this is compounded by openness to capital markets  This is the strongest and most robust finding in our study  Neither democratic nor popularly based governments consistently affect overall social spending  We then disaggregate spending into social security transfers and expenditures health and education  We find that popularly based governments tend to protect social security transfers  which tend to flow disproportionately to their unionized constituencies  but have a negative impact on health and education spending  Conversely  the change to democracy leads to increases in health and education spending  which reaches a larger segment of the population  We conclude by emphasizing the contrasting political logics of the different types of social spending
