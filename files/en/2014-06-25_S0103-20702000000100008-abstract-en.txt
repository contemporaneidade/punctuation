The history of democracy  in modern times  has coincided  in general terms  with the history of American democracy  Ever since Tocqueville pointed out the irresistible strength of this form of government  Western societies have done their best to adopt it as a model  It represents  to the great majority of contemporary people  the sole type of political regime that is able to lead humanity to its fulfilment   to conquer personal freedom and equality of opportunity  However  this equalitarian development is also responsible for the negative aspects of its functioning  Democracy runs the risk of transforming itself into its own antithesis  This would jeopardize its own system in two ways  by the action of its agents and by its specific excluding individualistic content  This paper tries to show  in a concise fashion  not only Tocquevilles concern over the destinies of this form of government  but also how equality  isolated from its material content  social  can generate a kind of discrimination which makes democratic society violent and unfair
