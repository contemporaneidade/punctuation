The aim of this article is to focus on Marx s political theory as announced in his Critique of Hegel s Philosophy of Right  from 1843  To reclaim young Marx means first and foremost to recover the essence of his political thought  which formed the ontological and epistemological basis for his subsequent work  My argument in this sense is that to recover the true statute of the political as announced by Marx in his 1843 manuscript allows laying the foundations for a new way of conducting political theory  particularly normative political theory
