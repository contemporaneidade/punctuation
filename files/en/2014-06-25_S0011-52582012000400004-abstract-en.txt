This study analyzes the phenomenon of switching party affiliations in Brazil  taking a different approach from that traditionally adopted  Rather than inquiring into the intentions of the migrating legislators  I attempt to understand party switching as a whole  seeking to grasp how the collective actors  in this case the political parties  use party switches to increase their power in the parliamentary and electoral arenas  By focusing on the moments in which party switches occur  it is possible to perceive the benefits derived by political parties whenever new members join their ranks
