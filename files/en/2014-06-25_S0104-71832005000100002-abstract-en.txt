In this article I take as a starting point the very possibility of thinking the so called cultural heritages in ethnographic terms  analyzing them as a  fait social total  following this rich concept elaborated by Marcel Mauss  I propose to explore the descriptive and analytical power of the category  patrimony   heritage  showing its multiple social and symbolic dimensions  and discussing its modern semantic features  By means of this procedure I hope to focus on some of its defining aspects which are expressed by such categories as  resonance   materiality  and  subjectivity  thus possibly bringing a possible contribution to the theoretical and political debates about the uses of the anthropological concept of culture
