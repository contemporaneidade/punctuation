This article examines theories of democracy which use different arguments to emphasize the role that associations play in promoting democratic ideals such as participation  equality  justice  legitimacy  deliberation and efficiency  In spite of theoretical and normative variants revealing differences in the treatment and value given to the role of associations  there are at least three approaches that can be identified from within this broad field of theoretical approaches  indicating the existence of positive if not alternative relationships between associations and democracy  participatory democracy  associative democracy and deliberative democracy  Although they all share a dissatisfaction with the liberal electoral model  pointing among other things to the competitive  individual weight that is given to the dimension of political participation  these models of democracy can also be understood in terms of analytical differences which demand more attention  For exponents of participatory democracy  their major argument on the democratic importance of associations is grounded in the thesis that associations are instruments which qualify citizen s direct participation  the true essence of democracy  For those affiliated with the theoretical current of associative democracy  associations are the possible  democratic solution for the management of social complexity  Theorists of deliberative democracy emphasize the importance of civil society   composed primarily of associations and social movments   in generating legitimate public sphere power  We suggest that the widening and deepening of democracy depends on the articulation  albeit never free of tensions   of premises of participation  representation  deliberation and association
