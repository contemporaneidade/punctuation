This article amplifies Tom Slater s diagnosis of the causes of the gentrification of recent gentrification research  It argues that the shift from the denunciation to the celebration of gentrification  the elision of the displacement of the established residents  and the euphemistic focus on  social mixing  partake of a broader pattern of invisibility of the working class in the public sphere and social inquiry  This effacing of the proletariat in the city is reinforced by the growing heteronomy of urban research  as the latter becomes more tightly tethered to the concerns of city rulers  Both tendencies  in turn  reveal and abet the shifting role of the state from provider of social support for lower income populations to supplier of business services and amenities for middle and upper class urbanites among them the cleansing of the built environment and the streets from the physical and human detritus wrought by economic deregulation and welfare retrenchment  To build better models of the changing nexus of class and space in the neoliberal city  we need to relocate gentrification in a broader and sturdier analytic framework by revising class analysis to capture the  de formation of the postindustrial proletariat  resisting the seductions of the prefabricated problematics of policy  and giving pride of place to the state as producer of sociospatial inequality
