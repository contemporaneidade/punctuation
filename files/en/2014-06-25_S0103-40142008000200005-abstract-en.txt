The climatic  social and economic characteristics in the Brazilian semi arid region require specific technologies of water resources uses and conservation  So  many alternatives for clean water acquisition must be analyzed  In opposition to the traditional way of accumulating water in small surface reservoirs and perforation of wells in crystalline terrains  alternatives have been looking like great depth wells in sedimentary areas  methodologies for evaporation reduction and salinization control  destination and use of effluents  Finally  works for river basins integration and water transport over long distances are starting to be built in Northeast region  The approach in those water policies for the Brazilian semi arid region is the purpose of this paper
