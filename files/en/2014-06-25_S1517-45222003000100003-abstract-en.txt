Modern economic theory has moved beyond  capital fundamentalism  In the words of Hoff and Stiglitz   2001  p  389   d evelopment is no longer seen primarily as a process of capital accumulation but rather as a process of organizational change  This realization has made possible an  institutional turn  in development theory that emphasizes the role of ideas and institutions as determinants of the possibilities for capital accumulation rather than the reverse  Both the  new growth theory  and Douglass North s  new institutionalism  are examples of the institutional turn  Unfortunately  the  institutional turn  has been used in a perverse way by global policy makers  The globally dominant view is that because institutions are so important  therefore an institutional blueprint based idealized versions of Anglo American institutions must be uniformly imposed on the countries of the global South in order for them to develop  Not surprisingly  this view has failed in practice  Alternative perspectives proposed by Rodrik and Sen argue that development is unlikely to succeed unless institutional change is grounded in local decision making  That is the view that is explored in this paper  The State of Kerala in India and the city of Porto Alegre in Brazil are used as concrete cases
