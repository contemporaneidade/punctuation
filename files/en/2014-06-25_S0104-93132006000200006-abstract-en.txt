The present article analyzes the universe of symbols utilized to represent babies in our society  which we treat here as  baby totemism  I present a description of this phenomenon  followed by a possible theoretical framework which can be used to analyze it  contrasting baby totemism with various other current theories regarding totemism  animism and naturalism  Through this  I attempt to question the notion that totemism is a marginal phenomenon in our society  proposing an alternate reading of theories regarding nature and culture in human societies  Finally  I present a critique of the notion of naturalism  which is seen here had being excessively privileged by the binary manner in which  occidental societies  structure nature and culture
