This article intends to study the insertion of Brazil at the Clean Development Mechanism  CDM  of the Kyoto Protocol  through clean energy projects  emphasizing the cooperation between developed and developing countries  and aiming the practical actions that this mechanism allows to build up in order to reach the sustainable development and to stop the global warming  To achieve this  an intense bibliographic review of the international agreements concerning climate change  and books and articles about the Brazilian insertion on the Kyoto Protocol and on the Clean Development Mechanism was done  The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement  which predicts the reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions through flexibly mechanisms  The Clean Development Mechanism is the only one that allows the participation of developing countries  for them to reduce emissions through projects that look for sustainable development  In this context  Brazil emerges as an attractive country to receive these projects  due to its vocation to develop alternative sources of energy and for its leadership on the Protocol s negotiation process  The CDM is therefore a great opportunity to Brazil  since these projects represent a source for financial resources for the country to seek the sustainable development  besides encouraging a greater scientific knowledge and the adoption of new and clean technologies
