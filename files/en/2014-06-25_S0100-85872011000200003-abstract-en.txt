Forty years ago  amidst the Cold War  Robert Bellah concluded his famous article on civil religion in America with the following question  how to conceive the applicability of the core values that undergird United States  imagined community beyond the territorial limits of its nation state  The current article intends to revisit this important question critically while referring it to recent global regulatory incursions performed by the USA on the field of religious freedom  First  I review the history of the relationship among secularism  national identity and Christianity in America  Secondly  I analyze the political and religious negotiations that give birth to the International Freedom of Religion Act  IRFA  in 1998  As a conclusion  I stress how this exercise might offer broader contributions to debates on the mutual orientation of religion  nationalism and secular power in contemporaneity  with an emphasis on the relationship between these and the principle of sovereignty
