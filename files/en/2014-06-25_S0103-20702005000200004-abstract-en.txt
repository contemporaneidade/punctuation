The risk is a central theme of the culture in modernity  The dominant culture in modernity has the pretension of affirming as universal the idea that dangers should be faced according to the principles of individualistic rationalism and utilitarianism that should guide the agent that takes the responsibility for the risk  The risk assumes form and relevance for the juvenile phase in the measure as it represents a construction process  an experimentation and statement of one s own identity  A process more and more fragmented and ambiguous that takes place through a prolongation of the transition to the adult life in the extent of a general dynamics of de institutionalisation of life  What is at play here is another typical demand of modernity  the one for reflexivity  as suggested by Giddens  it is the crucial challenge of the radical phase of modernity  We can recognize in the youths  actions  and precisely in those of a risky kind  the accomplishment of the imperative of doubting  through their acts  they suspend the suspension of the doubt  they accomplish a pragmatic form of reflexivity  The radical modernity produces a challenge  It has to be able to identify the proper stages for the construction and pragmatic experimentation of dynamics of confidence  It has to afford the empowerment of the agents  inscribing the use of such powers in social bonds that  besides being demonstrably effective and no ambivalent  do take into account as much the emotional dimension as the needs of the involved confidence in people s reliability
