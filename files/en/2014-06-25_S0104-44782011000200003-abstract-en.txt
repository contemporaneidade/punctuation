A fundamental premise for the development of a vigorous political theory is the possibility of providing a reflexive intelligibility for its own development and  for these purposes  relating its intrinsec explanations to the external history of its successes and failures  The goal of the present work is to carry out a tentative inventory of the development  problems and challenges of political theory in recent decades  in an attempt to analyze this development as part of a wider intellectual history  Thus  we must return to the 1960s  when the perception of a decline in theoretical reflection emerged  from this moment on  a surprising  resurgence  of political theory seems to have come about  The present text suggests that there has been a reconstruction of political theory over the last few decades involving a fundamental reconfiguration of its premisses  One of the central elements of this reconfiguration has been the progressive separation of philosophical and historical aspects of theoretical construction represented within this reconstruction by two of the theoretical currents that emerged in the 1970s  normative political theory and the history of political thought  This narrative  then  proposes the reconstruction of a particular point of view and emphasizes particular aspects of the theoretical elaboration that has unfolded over the last few decades  relegating the analyses of certain authors and formulations that although substantively important cannot be taken into consideration here
