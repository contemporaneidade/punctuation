This article discusses current approaches to the study of institutional change and innovation in the global environment  Although there is convergence in policy innovation as a result of globalization  there is a tendency to emphasize homogenization and leave aside variety and heterogeneity  We examine current explanations of how policy paradigms are diffused and consider how these explanations have been applied to a specific policy domain  namely pension reforms  The case study of Brazil s pension reform is presented in summarized form as an empirical illustration of the arguments developed in the theoretical discussion  We find that national responses to the influences of globalization are in fact shaped in crucial ways by domestic institutions and path dependency phenomena
