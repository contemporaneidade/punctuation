Democracy only became the preferred form of government in the 20th century  The new historical fact that led to the change in preference was the capitalist revolution  which changed the mode of appropriation of the surplus  from violence to themarket  Disappearance of fear of expropriation  the emergence of the middle classes  and pressure from the poor were the second  third  and fourth new historical facts that opened the way for the democratic transition  After these four conditions had been met  universal suffrage was guaranteed  The theory presented here does not predict transitions  since countries rarely become democratic without completely meeting historical conditions  but it does predict democratic consolidation  since no country that has completed its democratic revolution slips back into authoritarianism
