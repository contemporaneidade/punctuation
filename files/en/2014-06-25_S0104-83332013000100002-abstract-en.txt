The families formed by gay men and lesbians have become increasingly numerous and visible in many countries of the Western world  In France  gay fathers and mothers are mostly organized in associations  with the APGL as the main one  The French same sex families are derived from family reconstitution after divorce  adoptions  assisted reproduction or co parenting  The latter case  the object of this article  characterizes arrangements made by gays and lesbians to have children who move between the paternal and maternal homes  I argue that despite the relative historical novelty of the co parenting arrangements  the relationships between fathers and mothers continues to reproduce gender differences that  however  do not have the same meaning as in the families composed by heterosexual couples
