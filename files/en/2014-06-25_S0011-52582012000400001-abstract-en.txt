The view that minority governments are anomalies in the Parliamentary system has been abandoned for some time  However  in Presidential systems  minority governments are still seen as problematic  especiallywhen combined with unilateral Presidential agenda setting powers  This article analyzes the formation of governments  or cabinets  defined by their party composition and not by Presidential mandates  in 14 Latin American countries from 1979 to 2011  We test various hypotheses on the impact of institutional and political factors on the formation of minority governments  Our findings contradict predictions based on the prevailing theories  Specifically  we observed that the probability of minority governments increases proportionally with the strength of the President s veto power  We also observed that the President s agenda setting power and party fragmentation both have a negative effect on the formation of minority governments
