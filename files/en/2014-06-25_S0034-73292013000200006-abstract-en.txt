The aim of this paper is to study the interactions of regional and international pressure on the Pan Amazon  a region considered strategic for Brazil  Its importance lies in multiple fields  with emphasis on the environment and the economy  Two perspectives  although not incompatible  reveal themselves difficult to harmonize  especially when it converges to the exploitation of natural resources in the Pan Amazon and the exercise of national sovereignty over their territories  But the thematic scope of the article is even wider  since one of the main objectives of the study is to try to articulate the environmental and economic issues related to the Pan Amazon with policy issues related to regional security and national levels around the Brazilian Amazon  assuming that the issue is even more complex when contemplated in its regional dimension  Finally  we carried out an exercise on scenarios involving the Pan Amazon at both the regional and the international levels
