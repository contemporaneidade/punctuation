Watershed transposition is a 2000 years policy developed by the Romans to satisfy their continuous growing water demand  leading to the build up of an extensive network of aqueducts  This is the so called  old paradigm  still prevailing nowadays  for the relief of local water supply constraints on detriment of other regions  The systematic transfer of expressive amount of water from foreign sources  generating extra volumes of wastewater can no longer be accepted  both under economical as well as under environmental aspects  A  new paradigm  based on the concepts of Water Conservation and Reuse must evolve  to minimize costs and the environmental impacts associated with watershed transposition  The technology  as well as the basic environmental  public health and operational criteria now available  allow for a full harnessing of local water resources  through water reuse and adequate demand management
