In this paper we aim at pointing out theoretical approaches and alternative hypotheses to the critique of the notion of fairness in journalism  The proposal consists of a critical approach to theoretical positions that legitimate journalism as a guarantor of political pluralism  Based on the notions of perspective and situated knowledge worked out by Iris Marion Young and Nancy Fraser  we establish a shifting in relation to the liberal pluralist critique that maintains impartiality as some value guidance  Based on this discussion  we finally present three strictly bound working hypotheses on the relationship among the ideal of impartiality  legitimacy of the journalistic discourse  and its impact on the political field
