Among the main issues that have been making their presence felt in contemporary political theory of recent years are the themes of deliberation  community and communication  However  what the  new  debates on deliberative democracy  communitarianism and communication theory do not make clear is the fact that the  novelty  that they represent had already been enunciated in early twentieth century pragmatist theory  and in John Dewey s writings in particular  In essence  during the first few years of this century Dewey elaborated a consistent normative political theory whose principal focus was the issue of democracy  This would be of no particular relevance if Dewey s democratic theory did not actually develop a normative conception of participatory or deliberative democracy that is very similar to that of recent tendencies and exponents of contemporary democratic theory  Through reading Dewey and some of his commentators  we can identify concepts of  radical   procedural  and  deliberative  democracy that resonate strongly with themes of community  participation  communication  public space and education  Thus  the goal of this article is to revisit Dewey s thought  showing his vanguard relation to contemporary political theory and pointing to the relevance of his contribution for current debates within democratic theory
