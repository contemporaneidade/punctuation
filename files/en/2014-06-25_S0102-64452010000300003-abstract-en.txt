As shown by the recent literature on the revolution of independence  the articulation of a national identity  contrary to the assertions of the traditional national histories  was not the starting point but the end point of the process of rupture of the colonial ties  And this will have critical consequences for historiography  insofar as it raises the question of what was  then  what triggered that process  However  we must say that the criticism of the so called revisionist school paves the way to this interrogation only at the price of declaring it unsolvable  The statement that the persistence of traditional 252 imaginaries results into a view of the revolution of independence as a consequence of a series of accidents and circumstances  without managing to explain why those circumstances had the consequences they had  No doubt  some idea of nation was then at work  otherwise  royal vacancy shoud not have had the effects it did  Lastly  if trying to explain that process on the basis of a concept of nation that  as a matter of fact  only in the second half of the nineteenth century would become available is anachronical  so is the denial of the existence of any notion of nation  as if the above mentioned concept of it were the only possible one  The previous question can thus be translated as follows  what ideas of nation and self determination could have developed in that political and conceptual context  without which the kind of political rupture then occurred would not have possibly happen  in short  how could have emerged the ideas that the American territories of Spain and Portugal were nations  and that they could  therefore  postulate the possession of sovereign rights as such  The present paper intends to recreate the series of politico conceptual reconfigurations that have preceded the revolution in Latin America which  albeit they did not anticipated it  indeed opened the doors for it to become conceivable
