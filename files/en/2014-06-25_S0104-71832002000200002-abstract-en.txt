Ethnoarchaeology is still one of the lesser known areas of study in Anthropology  although it is central and has multiple relations to other fields  Initially  Ethnoarchaeology evolved as the study of the ethnographic material culture from an archeaological perspective  and during the past fifty years it has expanded both its scope and importance  Both authors are well known professionals and their theoretical approaches involve both the processualism of the New Archeaology and the post procesualism of the 1980s and 90s  The book is based on case studies  giving ample and equal coverage to different geographical regions and diverse themes  including analysis of material both in French and German  The introduction to Ethnoarchaeology and its history  and also a survey of the necessary ample theoretical spectrum and a discussion of field methods and ethics  are made in three chapters  Ten different thematic chapters deal with formation processes  subsistence  the study of production and styles of manufactured articles  sites  structures and architecture  craft work specialist production  commerce and trade  mortuary practices and ideology  The book concludes by examining both how Ethnoarchaeology has contributed and may still bring contributions to Anthropology  as well as the place it occupies in the discipline of Anthropology  The book is generously illustrated  including photographs of well known ethnoarchaeologists at work
