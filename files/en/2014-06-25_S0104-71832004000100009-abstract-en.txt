The Wiener s cybernetics theory  from 1940 s  has inspired researches and has influenced many scientific fields  including anthropology  Nowadays  the cybernetics is almost forgotten as a science but it has left important residues for the culture  These residues  amongst others from scientific and technical discourse  are creative means for the revaluations of social consensus about the meanings of things  As results of cultural process of reinvention  the cyborg and the cyberspace are emblematic references of a new order of real  which projects the old interpretational system of reality in new forms  constrained by its given historical and cultural possibilities of signification
