In 2003 Francisco de Oliveira published an article entitled  The Platypus  in which he makes some critical statements on the political conjecture of that historical moment  This article is full filled by a parallel between Darwinian evolutionism and the vision of the author on the contemporary Brazilian society  In doing such analogy  he incurred in a series of theoretical errors about the evolutionary theory  Those errors consist greatly in an inappropriate substitution between what has been known as  Social Darwinism  and the neo Darwinist theory as comprehended by their own proponents  The present work identifies those errors and contextualize them into the neo Darwinian theory  Besides  we show a historical portrait of the formation process of the evolutionary thinking in order to emphasize that the association between biology and social Darwinism is much more complex than it has usually been assumed
