The development of productive forces is an important object of study for contemporary social theory  Nonetheless  this relationship has been hitherto limited to consideration of technical elements of labor processes  Technology  new knowledge  and administrative and production techniques have been indicated as central elements in the constitution of the  revolutionary consciousness  of the working class  Today  in debates on non material labor  the direct relationship between the cognitive content of labor and the development of a politically revolutionary  consciousness  as a causal nexus between the political unity of the working class emerges as a fundamental explanatory axis  In this article  I attempt to discuss the role of professional qualification in the composition of theses on non material labor as a central productive force in capitalist societies  I will go on to critique these theses insofar as they argue that technical qualification informs the possibilities for revolutionary working class practice and political consciousness  I understand quite the opposite  that is  that capital today has reorganized the exploitation of labor according to its own interests  New forms of persuasion have been added on to the Taylorist and Fordist production techniques that disseminate ideas such as the one which poses the worker is a  partner  who should incorporate the  spirit  of the capitalist firm  Workers  subjectivity  thus reconstructed  is in this way reconfigured and reclaimed by capital
