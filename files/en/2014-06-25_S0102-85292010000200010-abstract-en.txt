This article proposes to establish a relation between the democratic security policy and the doctrine of national security in Colombia  with the intent of stressing the features of continuity between these two discourses and  based on that  understand the implications of democratic security policy for the present configuration of the national political scene  We will try to identify this continuity through an analysis of three processes  the formation of the Colombian armed forces  the role of the United States in Colombia s security policy and the formation of civil armed groups of paramilitary orientation  Articulating these three elements we argue that although the events of September 11 may have provided important political capital for the undertaking of the democratic security policy  its content and implication can only be made clear when we re establish its connection with the doctrine of national security
