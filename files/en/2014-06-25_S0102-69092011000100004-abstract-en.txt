Taking Raul Pompeia s suicide as our starting point  we aim at understanding how his intellectual and political trajectory reveals unimagined relations between sexuality and the public sphere within the Brazilian context at the turn of the 19th century  Author of the novel O Ateneu  1888  the young Republican developed a critique of the Empire through a story about the moral deviance that marked the education of the nation s elites  Pompeia saw his work and his political commitment within the Republican regime turn against himself  resulting from suspicions of a connection between political and sexual dissent that threatened him with public shame  This historical and sociological analysis reconstitutes the gender and sexual norms that made up the moral value system in which relations between individual and society in Brazil unfolded  We analyze Pompeia s drama by erasing the elusive borderlines amongst public and private lives  historical events  and subjective experience
