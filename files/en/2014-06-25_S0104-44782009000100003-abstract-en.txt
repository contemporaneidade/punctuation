This paper engages in a re reading of the historical chapters of Karl Marx s Capital  in the interests of working with the concept of  labor mobility  as it has been developed in the book that serves as the underlying theoretical reference for this article  the French scholar Jean Paul de Gaudemar s  Labor mobility and capital accumulation  The latter work is little known in Brazil  particularly within the area of Political Economy  Nonetheless  it is extremely important  given its approach to the concept and contribution toward building a more accurate interpretation of the determinants of contemporary capitalism and its new forms of exploitation  flexibilizing  sub contracting  re engineering  etc  Thus  through a heightened understanding of the concept of labor mobility  we seek to make some incursions into central themes on the process of capital accumulation  with particular concern for issues such as unemployment and labor processes that lead to increased extraction of relative and absolute surplus value and that consequently lead to a drop in the wage levels of a large part of the working classes  increasing the informality and precariousness in their material conditions of life  We are able to observe that the exhaustion of patterns of capital accumulation during the transition from the 1960s to the 1970s has promoted profound changes in the way the system functions  leading to more indirect forms of exploitation and to more sophisticated and efficient forms of cultural and ideological control
