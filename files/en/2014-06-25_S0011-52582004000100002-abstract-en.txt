ISEB was a group of Brazilian nationalist intellectuals in the 1950s who conceived the country in global sociological and political terms  They defined development in broad terms as a capitalist and national revolution  and more specifically as an industrialization process through which the growth of per capita income would become self sustained  In the process of nation building and institutionalization of a national market  a domestic bourgeoisie would join with the state bureaucracy and workers  having the national interest as the common objective or criterion  These ideas were criticized by the S o Paulo School of Sociology  which emerged ten years later  rejecting nationalism and insisting on the existence of class conflict  However  ISEB s errors were not related to this critique  Rather  the Institute overestimated the capacity of the modern sector to absorb the labor surplus in the traditional sector and underestimated the possibility that a crisis stemming from excessive foreign indebtedness might put a halt to the national revolution
