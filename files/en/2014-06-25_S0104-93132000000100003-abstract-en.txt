Two broad trends have characterized the interpretation of documents which report on Pentecostal conversion  On the one hand  a  constructivist  tendency is observed  where the subject s narrative is seen as an artificial response or reflex to the forces of expectations and external pressure  On the other hand  narratives on conversion are treated as being the centre of analysis  and interpreted as the direct expression of some new disposition of the self  In this article a third interpretation is put forth  based on conversion reports from Brazil and Portuguese  Evangelicists  in which conversion is itself treated as a narrative genre which incorporates the life experiences of common men and women who have come to  accept Jesus Christ  and which gain  through this event  a measure of similitude  In this way one guarantees the commensurability of life his stories without imposing a single meaning upon them
