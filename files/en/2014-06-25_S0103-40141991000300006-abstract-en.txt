The economical crisis and the emergence of the  new technologies  in the 70 s brought a new popularity to the work of Joseph Schumpeter  In this article  the author discusses how recent history has danied Schumpeter s predictions concerning the passage of capitalism to socialism  First of all  it has not been proved that rationalization of industrial progress redacts the level of inovation  extinguishing the roles of the entreprensur and the inventor  It is quite the opposite  for the aleatory character of inovation is such that a not planned economy suits much better its nature  Concerning the second aspect  the growing role of the State in the activities of research development  the world scene of 1945 has changed drastically from the 70  s onward when the civil markets demand for high technology outweighted the public demands  The third point relates to the function of intellectuals  The expansion and simultaneous devaluation of superior education generate an exceeding number of individual who develop a critical view towards the system  But if such  hostility  is due only to resentment  as Schumpeter believes  it will never have enought strength to put an end to capitalism  Therefore  if there is nothing  from an economical point of view  that postulates the disappearance of capitalim  the sociological and psychological reasons expouded by Schumpeter have the same weakness of ideological statements
