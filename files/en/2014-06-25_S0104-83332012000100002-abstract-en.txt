In this paper  we try to tell the history of the exhibition of sex in movies mainly produced in the United States in almost a century  Asking when  why and how the United States became   from a culture that did not exhibit sex   into a culture that exhibits it  the author insists in the double sense of the verb to screen  as both a revelation and a dissimulation  To exhibit is to reveal in a screen  But another  and important  sense  as says the dictionary  is  to protect or hide behind a screen  Movies show as well as they reveal  The paper analyzes the way social change in the United States  for example the sexual revolution of the sixties and new views on sexuality allowed new ways of representing sex in the movies  creating a new relation between public and private  The paper also asks how our bodies and senses react to sex in the screen  introducing the idea of  carnal knowledge
