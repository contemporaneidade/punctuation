This article aims to provide an approach on a possible inflexion ongoing in contemporary electoral comparative studies  challenging the consensus reached in the 1980s and 1990s around the idea of the loss of the relative importance of social divisions and  in particular  classists  as the explanatory variable of electoral behavior in advanced democracies  In that sense  the text presents and discusses samples of recent international studies that converge on the revaluation of social class as a source of guidance on vote  It is pointed out the attributed importance by this new literature on the methodologic question and in the review of empirical information collected in the last decades by vote  especially some of the results that suggest a new understanding of the relationship between class and suffrage in mature democracies
