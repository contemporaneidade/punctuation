This paper aims at examining the different ways by which Joaquim Nabuco shapes his personality in My Formation  choosing the trip as theme  especially to Europe  as the conductor thread for the investigation  Having always by reference the way by which political and literary values match in his thoughtfulness  we intend to suggest that his subjectivity seems to be elaborated leastwise at two distinct levels  thou tightly articulated  The first one corresponds to the youth of the author  pronounced by a melancholic curiosity that implies  on the limit  a fast and superficial contact with the targets he aims at knowing  the second entails a relation with the tradition level  especially the British one  whose permanence  extension  and variety will promote an ambience of serenity and freedom that turns out to be one kind of axis around which Nabuco conceives his biography
