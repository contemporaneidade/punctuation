Inspired by Marcel Mauss  this article argues that prayer  besides its evident theological and doctrinal aspects  is a ceremony that allows subjects to think about their social  political and economic conditions  This argument will be explored through an ethnography about Bangladeshis  that sustain a transnational livelihood between Portugal and Bangladesh  carried out between 2003 e 2008  Through such exercise  I intend to show how discourses and practices around and about salat  the five daily prayers of the Islamic calendar  reveal several aspects of the migratory experience and the place of Bangladeshis in Portugal  It will be further argued that prayer is not only a metaphor but also a key ritual practice through which certain segments and actors act upon the world they live in
