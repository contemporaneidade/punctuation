This paper discusses the problematic relationship between urban issues and social issues  from classical studies to contemporary dilemmas  Drawing on French authors  this paper studies the crisis of the cities as an expression of acute contemporary social issue  It presents the transition from conventional approaches of social class on the urban structure  that guided urban studies in the 60s 70s  the deregulation of the nineties  which produced social processes of dissocialization  and the paradox of the managerial vision of the city  away from the dimension of redistribution of the welfare state  It examines the urban polarization through notions of exclusion  underclass and the suburbanization of cities and concludes by showing how territory questions the State and society through a culture of daily urban violence  Finally  it states that the challenge is not restricted to market relations  or to a political order  but concerns politics and the conditions the  city  has to produce  society
