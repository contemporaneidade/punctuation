Aztec cannibalism has been the object of numerous interpretations that have characterized it in ecological  cultural or symbolic terms  or as a piece of colonial propaganda  A revision of the most widely known Spanish  Indigenous and Mestizo sources shows that this quest for wide ranging explanations has been reductionist  The complexity of the sources  in which cannibalism  depending on its qualification  emerges as a heterogeneous  prescriptive or nefarious object  endowed with extensive sociological meaning and pointing towards divergent versions of cosmology  has been largely overlooked  The article also proposes a comparison between Aztec cannibalism and its equivalent along the Brazilian coast and in Amazonia  which attests to its coincidence in a transformational cosmology
