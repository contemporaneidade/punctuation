Alexandre Koyr  has named the scientific revolution of the XVIIth century as Plato s revenge  The author suggests that the XXth century saw a similar  if much less spectacular  revenge  that of Hume s naturalism  By Hume s naturalism he means the view that every conceivable epistemological project is doomed to failure since there is nothing to be said about knowledge with the exception of what can result from an inquiry into the origins of people s beliefs  In this century  this view echoed in the thoughts of Dewey and Wittgenstein  and culminated in Bloor s  strong sociology of knowledge  in Rorty s wittgensteinian pragmatism  and in Latour s  symmetrical anthropology  He argues that these different versions of humean naturalism lie in a predarwinian conception of knowledge  which should profitably be replaced with a genuine Darwinian view
