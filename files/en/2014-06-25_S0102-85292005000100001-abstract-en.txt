The purpose of this article is to deconsecrate the heroic status that international relations students have attached to Hobbes s texts   an attachment that results from their inclusion  together with texts by Thucydides  Machiavelli  Rousseau and Hegel  in the realist epic  We will see that the subsuming of the philosopher under the  realist tradition  is rarely questioned  even by the critics of the conceptions endorsed by it  Therefore  the name of Hobbes remains  in a large extent  associated to the analogy between international anarchy and the state of nature  In the first place  we ll bring to light the hypothetical status of the state of nature model  emphasizing the fact that Hobbes himself recognized the limitation of its motivational reductionism to the description of reality  Secondly  having taken as a premise the fact that the dichotomy inside outside did not exist in Hobbes s time  we ll explore the argument that international peace would be directly associated to the resolution of the problem of order in domestic societies
