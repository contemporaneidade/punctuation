The purpose of this work is to rethink the process of capitalist development  pointing out to some of global society s numerous contradictions  Two central issues are examined  the growing process of social exclusion of a sizable part of the world population and the role of the nation state  The latter is seen as extremely relevant in the light of the system s intrinsic trend to concentrate wealth while expanding poverty  when the state comes as the only real safeguard for vital interests of those excluded in each country  Some aspects of the current crisis in the capitalist system and the impact of the neoliberal model in deepening social contradictions and polarizing class interests are also discussed  A reflection on alternative forms of social organization is put forward
