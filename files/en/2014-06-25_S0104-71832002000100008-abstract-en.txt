In this paper I discuss some challenges posed by the AIDS epidemic to those involved in the promotion of health among men with homosexual practices  Although homosexuals are at the forefront of the struggle against the epidemic  with a mobilization that has generated the creation of NGOs  safe sex manuals and the promotion of human rights  they are still suffering with the association AIDS homosexuality  I divide the challenges into three fields  epidemiology  prevention and care  I highlight the importance of interdisciplinarity among the different fields of knowledge  solidarity among researchers and activists and the integration of prevention and care actions  The lessons learned indicate that solidarity and the promotion of happiness should be the basis upon which the relations between homosexuality and health should be determined
