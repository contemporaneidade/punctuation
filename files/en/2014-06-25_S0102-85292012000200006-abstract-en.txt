The article analyzes energy related issues among the BRICS countries and the potential refashioning of the world energy order that might spring from them  It begins by investigating the growing impact of the BRICS countries within the international order  with the intention of tracking their progress in an ambit so far restricted to developed countries and their oil suppliers  The text subsequently analyzes the energy matrix of each of the five BRICS countries from the points of view of political economy and sustainability  Finally  based on the previous sections  the final section of the article maps the tensions and complementarities between the BRICS and outlines the possibilities and limits of their cooperation on energy issues  The analysis concludes that given the potential for energy related cooperation between these countries  a clear definition of their national energy supply and demand may allow the grouping to position itself as a new pole in the world energy market
