WITH ONE of the central concepts of environmental discourse   that of ecological sustainability   we analyse the social diversity of contemporary Amazonia  presenting classification of Amazonian social segments according to the degree of environmental sustainability of their productive activities  With no intention of covering all of Amazonian social diversity  we identify nine of its main segments  Indians of sporadic commerce  Indians of recurrent commerce  Indians dependent on mercantile production  traditional peasants  traditional ranchers  recently established ranchers  frontier migrants  large scale entrepreneurial projects  and itinerant extraction producers  The analysis of each socio environmental category takes into account the characteristics of their economic orientation and ecological cultures  Besides these features  the complex interaction among multiple asocial and environmental factors is demonstrated to explain the specific ecological behaviour displayed by each social segment  With this exercise  some consecrated stereotypes are proven false  such as those that indicate negative correlations between sustainability and demographic density or poverty  and positive correlations between sustainability and Indian identity  We conclude by pointing out the importance of following broad spectrum analyses in order to understand the socio environmental diversity of contemporary Amazonia
