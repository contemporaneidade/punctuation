Having as parameter the concept of civil society elaborated by the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci  this article intends to critically dialogue with other ideas of civil society currently found in the political and cultural panorama  Its main argument is that in the last few decades there has been a change from the idea of civil society as field predominantly political statist  placement of democratic fights and new hegemonies  to an image that turns the civil society either in some managerial resource   a societal arrangement to make possible specific types of public policies   or in a factor of social life ethical and dialogical reconstruction  On the one hand  the incorporation of the idea of participation to the planning language has moved the civil society from its main field  that one of organizing new hegemonies  converting it in a space of cooperation crisis management  On the other hand  the expansion of the State and representative democracy social activism  in a political crisis picture  has impelled the search for a new  place  from where it would be possible to establish and disseminate both new ethical postulations and new collective procedures  From a phase where Marxism both preponderated in discussions and left its hallmark we have ingressed into a time where the liberal perspective  stated with orthodoxy and nuance  prevails and operates as main reference
