The text presents and analyses feminist critics to the adjustments between the liberal value of individual free choice and material and symbolic iniquities that restrain individual autonomy  The focus is primarily a critical analysis of voluntary consent  a basic notion to liberalism  The aspects related to consent and rape are discussed to expose the limits of the liberal duality between coertion and free choice  Departing from gender relations and the vulnerabilities that concern women s social position  it is possible to have a better understanding of the connections between consent in liberal societies  day by day life and consent in liberal democratic State  These analyses result in a desplacement of the focus  from the expression of preference and choice as voluntary acts  to self determination as a primary value to democracy  Two sets of issues are  therefore  considered  those emerging from situations in which the differences between consent and non consent are nullified   nullifying also individual s moral agency   and those emerging from situations in which consent exists  but leads to subordination or deepens individual vulnerability
