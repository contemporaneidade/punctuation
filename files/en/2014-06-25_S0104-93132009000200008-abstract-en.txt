This text discusses how virtual objects participate interactively in the production of knowledge in scientific practice  The article is based on the ethnographic observation of an interdisciplinary team of scientists whose work involves computer modelling of heat transfer in the human prostate  The ethnography found that although scientific imaging may be considered a form of  simplifying  the apprehension of data  an intense interpretative process is required to achieve shared meanings concerning the images  These meanings are constructed through oral communication and embodied interactions with virtual objects during the interactions between scientists  A better understanding of these interpretative practices is needed given the growing importance of the use of 3D digital imaging and computational models in contemporary science  These techniques are increasingly used not only to describe truths about nature  but also as powerful tools for intervening in the world
