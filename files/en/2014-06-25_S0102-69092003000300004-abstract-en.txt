The paper analyses the insertion of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God  UCKG  in the national politics scenario and its effects in the religious and political fields  Due to the efficacy of its institutional charisma  the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God  UCKG  has given  within its own religious group  a new meaning to the specific act of voting and to the general perception of politics in general  putting both of them in its own religious logic  This is an important explanatory key for the high level of loyalty in voting and the growing political success verified in every new election  Furthermore  the political practice of the UCKG is producing a mimetic effect on other evangelic churches  which tend to imitate its way of doing politics  Its political insertion  mainly through the Liberal Party  has not remained unnoticed by the political parties  making the fact a relevant actor in the current Brazilian political conjuncture
