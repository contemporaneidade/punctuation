This article originated in online research about the discourses and practices of  barebacking  in the Brazilian context  In this work  I discuss some communities on the internet that highlight the positive aspects of unprotected sex  without necessarily being identified or linked to the concept of barebacking  In general  what connects these discourses  sex without condoms and barebacking  is the search for more natural and free experiences   sensations and pleasures that are more intense  Therefore  I conclude that what is central to unprotected sex is the possibility of maximization of pleasure in the most intimate contact with one s partner
