This paper intends to contribute to a better understanding of the dimension and possible solutions for hunger and malnutrition in Brazil  We start by clarifying conceptual distinctions between hunger and malnutrition and what distinguishes these two problems from poverty  Then we examine available alternatives to implement the concepts of poverty  malnutrition and hunger in field studies aiming to assess the magnitude of these problems in the population  Finally  we present and compare results on the frequency  distribution and secular trends of poverty  malnutrition and hunger in Brazil and we also discuss its main implications to the design of public policies aiming the control of these problems
