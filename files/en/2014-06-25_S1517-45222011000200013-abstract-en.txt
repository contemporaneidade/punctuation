In this paper we discuss police deontology and codes of ethics used in two police institutions  the Military Police of the Federal District  Brazil  and the Ottawa Police Service  Canada  First  we analyse and compare contents of these documents  Following  we examine how each of those police institutions coordinates its training and evaluation systems with its own deontological code  Finally  we find that the existence of deontolgy codes in itself  without administrative regulation  does not guarantee the appropriate control of police activities  Furthermore  we identified a need for assimilation of such codes and administrative regulations by the police training and evaluation systems
