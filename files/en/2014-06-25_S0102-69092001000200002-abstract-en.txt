The paper analyses the role of ideas and political networks that explain the content of stabilization policies implemented in Brazil after 1985  A set of innovative heterodox ideas concerning the most appropriate stabilization strategy for Brazil were designed by economists from the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in the early 1980s  The paper presents these ideas and compares them with the contents of two stabilization programs designed and implemented by the same economists   the  Cruzado Plan   1986  and the  Real Plan   1993 present  Political variables are emphasized in the explanation showing a greater similarity of the Real Plan to the original ideas of those economists which  for the author  accounts for the success of that program to control inflation
