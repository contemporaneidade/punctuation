This text  prepared at the invitation of the American Historical Association for its opening plenary session in January 2001  concerns the construction of historical narrative by anthropologists  in particular myself  It quickly traces anthropologists  growing concerns with ethical and epistemological issues and the effects this has had on narrative strategies  And it provides a brief overview of my own experiments with narrative form in history  beginning with First Time and Alabi s World  and ending with The Convict and the Colonel
