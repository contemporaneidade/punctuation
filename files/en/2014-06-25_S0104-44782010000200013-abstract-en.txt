This article makes a diagnosis of the land ownership situation for currently existing Brazilian national parks  We argue that Brazilian cultural and political heritage  the historical record left by the administrative organs managing national parks and the complexity of the land problem are determining factors in holding back processes of regularization of land use and ownership within these  conservation units   CUs  We maintain that the paucity of financial resources for indemnification of lands that have been appropriated is not the greatest obstacle in resolving the matter  We propose  furthermore  that diverse alternative legal and administrative instruments could be deployed to regularize or incorporate land into national parks and therefore make policies for conserving the country s biodiversity more effective  Finally  we conclude that conserving biodiversity goes far beyond the creation of conservation units of whatever sort  making it necessary for different segments of public power and civil society to invest as well in actions of monitoring  formation of ecological corridors between fully protected and sustainable use CUs   environmental education and the implantation of economic instruments for environmental management that induce private owners of land to adopt practices that are compatible with the preservation of nature
