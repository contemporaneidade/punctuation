Several studies showed that the atmosphere on the forest  free of pollutants  have low concentrations of Condensation Nuclei of the clouds  concentrations typical of the atmosphere at sea  In low concentrations of NCN  microphysics properties of clouds are more sensitive to the increase of NCN  In Amazon  the master source is the vegetation cover of the forest  Then  an increase in emissions of NCN by anthropogenic activities can have a strong impact on local weather  These results are discussed in this paper
