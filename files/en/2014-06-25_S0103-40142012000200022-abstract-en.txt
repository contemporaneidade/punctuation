At the time of new technological schemes and global risks  scientific thinking developed in the Brazilian experience celebrates a memorable text of little more than 40 years  Science and Liberation  written by the nuclear physicist J  Leite Lopes  This paper investigates this thought  which communicates with the critical scientific horrified by the rubble of postwar and design a vision of epistemological rupture in view of social reality  This movement becomes a proposal for a management of knowledge  The methodological approach of this essay seeks texts that bear witness to and from post war twentieth century  and contributions from the natural sciences and culture aimed at building a democratic society  The work of Leite Lopes lies there like a bunch of languages in the service of social change and the effective development of Brazil and Latin America
