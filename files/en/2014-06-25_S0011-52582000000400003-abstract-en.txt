In the literature analyzing democratization processes  a central discussion is that institutional arrangements and historical aspects have an influence on the chances of success  The main prescriptions in the literature point to certain arrangements  such as the combination of either Parlamentarianism  proportional representation  and bicameralism or that of Presidentialism and majority representation  as favoring the democratization process  Using the Boolean method  the article tests these hypotheses in the African context and reaches the conclusion that the main prescriptions in the literature are inadequate for analyzing democratization in Africa
