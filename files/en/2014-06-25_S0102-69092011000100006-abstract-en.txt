In 2008  the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the Japanese immigration to Brazil resulted in the spread of a celebratory discourse on the idea of  Japanese culture  However  this discourse was based on an essentialist view  which neglected the several conflicts inherent to this issue  One of the reasons is the absence in Brazil of a discussion about the debates involving the main social thinkers working on the study of the construction  transformation  and critique of the concept of Japanese culture  This article aims at proposing a sketch of these major debates on the notion of Japanese culture  as well as its historical context  Based on this overview  I briefly reflect on how the Japanese culture has been approached in Brazil  as well as the consequences that the current discourse has had for both Brazilian and Japanese societies
