Jews came to Brazil  to stay for good  from the first half of the 16th century  Yet settling in Brazil has been an ongoing project throughout the five centuries of Jewish immigration  They frequently had to hide their Jewish condition and  from the 18th century onwards  overcome political ideological persecutions in order to safeguard their own identity and fight for their citizenship  How have these demands and struggles affected the relationships between men and women and among Jewish families  So how have these relationships been organized among Jews  Were inequalities brought along with their luggage  Or were the relations based on male dominance of women incorporated by Jewish immigrants after they arrived in Brazil  Can we affirm that relationships between Jewish men and women were generally egalitarian
