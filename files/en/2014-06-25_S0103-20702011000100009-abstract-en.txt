Based on a detailed discussion of some of the central arguments of Pierre Bourdieu s Pascalian Meditations  this article looks to show that the sociologist s work contains a permanent tension between  the critique of  universalism and  the critique of  relativism  Firstly the text shows how even Bourdieu s earliest writings reveal certain relativist tendencies in which the notion of the arbitrary plays a central role  This set of propositions is then compared and contrasted with the critiques directed by Habermas and Bourdieu himself against Foucault and so called postmodernist approaches  before turning to how the author presents an opposing set of arguments from the mid 1970s onwards that seek to ground reason on social bases  Finally  the two perspectives are compared in a way that exposes their paradoxical intersections as well as their potential points of reconciliation
