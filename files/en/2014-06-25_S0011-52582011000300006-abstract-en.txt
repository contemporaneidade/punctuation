This article reconstructs the theoretical trajectory of Gabriel Cohn  whose work can be divided broadly into two phases  In the first  particularly under the influence of Adorno and Weber  modernity is viewed from the angle of domination and a tendency towards the construction of oppressively inclusive systems  In the second  maintaining these fundamentals  the issues of  pluralism  and indifference  particularly with a critical reading of Luhmann  are perceived as shaping a new pattern of civilization  Cohn thus proves to be a fundamental theoretical reference for understanding modernity in both its initial and contemporary phases
