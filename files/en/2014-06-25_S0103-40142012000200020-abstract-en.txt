By considering scientific knowledge as a form of symbolic thought  we do not mean by the latter simply systems of signs  but thought contents  expressed by concepts  related between them and providing meaning   they are  in the space of mental representations  the substitutes of the  objectively given  that one supposes to underly the experience of the  world  done through the senses and the understanding  both being indissociable at this level  This symbolic thought gets density and consistence in the  weaving  that is made  through the work of the individuals thoughts put together in social and cultural communication  and immersed in the time of history  The dynamical tension between the subject of knowledge  who is looking for intelligibility  by the operations of his reasoning  and the objectivity he aims at of the knowledge contents  first given to him  and then modified or renewed by him  produces as an effect the movement of scientific thought and the transformations of knowledge  This work of the symbolic thought is characterized by a style proper to each acting subject  but which may exhibit some common features in given contexts  schools or traditions  In science and in history of science  style intervenes at two levels   that one of the   objectal   approach of the production of works by scientists  and that one of the   reflexive   approach by epistemological history and by philosophy  which inquire about the meaning of the knowledge contents themselves as well as about that of the rational  symbolic  thought whose function is to bring them to light
