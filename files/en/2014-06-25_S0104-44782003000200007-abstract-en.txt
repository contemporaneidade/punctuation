This article examines the relationship between democracy  political culture and social capital in Brazil  The topic is approached comprehensively  based on the belief that the above concepts are in permanent interaction  In the Brazilian case  however  it is possible to identify several factors that have historically had a impact on the configuration of a type of political culture  hybrid in nature  that brings together attitudes that are favorable to democracy and negative toward political institutions  It is argued that this problem is neither temporary nor conjunctural  rather  it is structural and poses difficulties for strengthening democracy  Within such a scenario the development of social capital would increase citizens  power  in theory and practice  allowing them wider participation in the political arena  Data used here are based on quantitative and qualitative research carried out in the state of Rio Grande do Sul  between 1974 and 2000  Study results suggest that Brazilians are weak on ability to cooperate  which may explain low rates of political participation and consequent democratic instability
