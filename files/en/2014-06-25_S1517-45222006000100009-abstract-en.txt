This essay is aimed at claiming the presence of the human body in epistemological and pedagogical reflections  It stars from the following hypothesis  in pre modern times  the philosophical and sociological discourses point to an overcoming of enlightening rationality  The pedagogical proposals seek interdisciplinary perspectives  new forms of curricula configuration and organization of school space  References are often heard about a pedagogy of complexity  However  it is in that same school and within that same pedagogy that paradoxically the paradigm of Enlightenment s rationalism inspiring an intellectualist education remains  taking over the Cartesian heritage that conceives the body as a mere extension of mind  Three themes make up the arguments for the guiding hypothesis   1  in the schools of our times  the body seen as res extensa remains passive  That is to say  the body does not go to school   2  the main epistemological views on the origin of knowledge also limit themselves to the expression of predominantly rational knowledge  The body remains absent from epistemological interest   3  A pedagogy limited to what is exclusively rational is shortsighted and therefore cannot demand to be configured as a pedagogy of complexity  It is necessary to place bodies within epistemology  pedagogy  and schools  It is the reinvention of bodies
