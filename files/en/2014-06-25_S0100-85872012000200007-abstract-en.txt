In this article I return to the debate on the cosmology of the  Spiritual Battle  relating it to the constituting of gender among Pentecostals  Supported by ethnographic data  I argue that a more nuanced understanding of Pentecostal dualism should include  as well as the on going negotiations founded on relations with alterity  the performance of the relation with an  original source  since  very explicitly  the Pentecostals do not identify themselves as  authors  of the person constituted by them  but claim that they are  witnesses  of the biblical word and  imitators  of Christ
