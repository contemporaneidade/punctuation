How do institutions foster corruption  How does the unveiling of corruption scandals affect institutional reform  This essay takes the Brazilian budget process from 1988 onwards as a case study in an attempt to answer both these questions  In this period  two corruption scandals in the budget process were uncovered  the  budget dwarves  in 1993 1994 and  budget leeches  in 2006  The first scandal is a classic example of how institutional centralization  coupled with informality  results in corruption  the second scandal illustrates how corrupt actors work within a partially decentralized institutional scenario  Both scandals resulted in partial  and somewhat effective  institutional reforms
