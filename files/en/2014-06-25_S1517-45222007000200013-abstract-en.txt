The considerable development of qualitative methods over the last 20 years is intrinsically related to the  linguistic turn  The assumption that recorded texts are the basic data for all scientific research is therefore responsible for that prevalence of text interpretation methods and for such particular  fixation  on texts within qualitative methodologies  However  a difference has to be established between communication about  ber  image and communication through  durch  image  Methodological access to the pre conceptual or  atheoretical  understanding was introduced in the 1920s by the iconology of Erwin Panofsky and his contemporary Karl Mannheim with his documental interpretation method  Important correspondences can be demonstrated between the two approaches as well as regarding the field of semiotics  Based on the understanding that the iconic character in its obstinateness is not properly available to us through language  we may conclude   referenced in the aforementioned authors as well as in Barthes  Foucault  and Imdahl   that apprehending an image s peculiarities implies suspending   placing in parentheses  our connotations  based on the iconographic previous knowledge mediated by language  as much as possible  Methodologically  the iconic character can only be reconstructed through the description of form  especially image s planimetric structure  The documental method of image interpretation is fit to face such challenge
