Starting from the existing literature  this paper proposes an analytical framework to capture the general dynamics of the controversies in environmental health and  more particularly  the role of the  layman  in this issue  within democratic societies  The article emphasizes the importance of a research work conducted by non specialists to provide tangible demonstration of the existence of a health problem related to their environment  This research work provides for two processes that are at the center of the dynamics of these controversies  the victimization  i e  the transformation of ill people into victims  and the questioning  i e  the attribution of certain pathologies to environmental factors  The identification of these two processes  which may be concurrent  makes it possible to distinguish different settings and to understand how a controversy evolves over time
