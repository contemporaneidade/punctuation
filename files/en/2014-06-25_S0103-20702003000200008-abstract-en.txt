This paper analyses the macroeconomic policy of FHC s second government  1999 2002  that was marked by fiscal  foreign exchange and monetary changes  In the fiscal area  a primary superavit was generated and the efforts towards a structural reform were increased  Regarding foreign exchange policies  the move from administered exchange to one of dirty floating allowed for an adjustment of the high deficit in the current account that occurred in the first term of office  In the monetary field  the regime of inflation goals substituted the subordination of the monetary policy to the defense of the exchange regime  These alterations brought a more sustainable and transparent regime to the country  but its efficiency was limited due to the inheritance of the old regime  that generated unbalances and also to the international and domestic financial instabilities of the period  The new regime is adequate for the creation of conditions for the recovery of investments and for economic growth  but the main present chalenges have more to do with the institutional and regulatory aspects than with the macroeconomic policy regime
