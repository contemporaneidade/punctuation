Described over 150 years ago  glial cells  nerve tissue constituents together with neurons  were until recently considered supporting cells of the brain  Especially in the last decade  the Neurosciences have witnessed a paradigm shift related to the function and role of these cells in neural physiology and pathology  In this chapter  we discuss how advances in the knowledgement about astrocytes  the most abundant glial cell type  contributed to the understanding of brain functioning  We will present evidence of the relationship between glial dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases and neurological disorders  discussing the potential role of these cells in the development of therapeutic approaches for the adult nervous system
