This paper analyzes the conflicts and articulations behind the transformation of an old swampish area  the meadows of the Pinheiros river  in one of the most valued regions of S o Paulo and its globalized face  The text discusses particularly the connections made in the last decades between the global financialization of the economy and the specific arrangements that take place in S o Paulo  among supposedly advanced mechanisms   such as urban operations  Cepacs and real estate investment funds   and typical forms of primitive accumulation  in which strength  frauds  oppression and pillage are recurrently exhibited  between the  city proper  of the elites and the so called clandestine city  that occupies stream edges  hillsides  margins of dams  I investigate three icons of that urban landscape  a cable supported bridge  synthesis of the  new city  scenery  a gigantic walled development  that mixes residential  luxury trade and office buildings  and a business compound with office and hotel towers  interlinked by an underground shopping center
