The article aims to investigate and discuss not only the innovations but also the limitations  tensions  and gaps in Jon Elster s methodological concepts  characterized by a type of intentional causal explanation whose premise is methodological individualism and which chooses the search for explanatory mechanisms as the fundamental analytical strategy  The Norwegian author s theoretical trajectory is reconstructed and articulated with his  methodology of explanation  Next  this  methodology of explanation  is submitted to analysis by raising and discussing some objections to this approach  as well as answers to such questions that can be found in Elster s work
