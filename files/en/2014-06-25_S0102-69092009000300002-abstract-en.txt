This article discusses a specific crime   assault   usually registered in domicile victimization surveys  as compared to stealing and robberies  It debates whether rational choice theory is suitable to understand crimes as registered in theses surveys  As far as assault is concerned  this theory is unable to explain the association between social context and victimization risk  markedly different for women and men  as well as more linked to power and recognition than to material gains or assets  Furthermore  the differences between feminine and masculine patterns of victimization by assault could not be interpreted only by the commonly used theory of the patriarchal family  and should be illuminated by recent changes in urban life  family patterns and in the construction of masculine identities and practices  as suggested by the theories of hyper masculinity or warrior ethos  This may be useful for changing public policies aiming prevention of violence in interpersonal relationships
