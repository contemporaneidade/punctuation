The purpose of this article is the critical reconstitution of the contemporary debate on two of the most preeminent perspectives in the Sociology of Law   rationalist historicism  deriving from Max Weber s studies  and systemic theory as developed by Niklas Luhmann with its reflexive variation in Gunther Teubner  These two schools of sociology express different perspectives for our understanding of the ties between juridical phenomena and social relations  in spite of their Germanic origins  they have influenced a wide number of thinkers in England and the U S  On the one hand  the Weberian perspective  which has inspired an infinite number of empiricist currents  maintains an enormous intellectual hold on Anglo American sociology  committed to the systematization of information collected from primary  historic and documentary sources  on the other hand  there is the combination of Luhmann s systemic theory and the concept of  autopoiesis  taken from Biology  which attempts a vigorous interpretation of the Sociology of Law which quite ingeniously reconstructs the objects of Law and Sociology to explain the nature of social and juridical phenomena  In our attempt to discuss the theoretical models that pertain to these perspectives and test their limits and potential for explaining contemporary problems related to Law and society  we make the connections between the general assertions of these theories and the general assumptions that their respective epistemologies present
