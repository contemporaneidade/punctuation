Rather than producing an analytically robust concept of  ghetto  the social sciences have used the term descriptively  not rarely attributing to it the common sense meaning that it is given in the societies where the phenomenon is identified  Through the historiographic production on the Jewish diaspora in renaissance Europe  the sociology of black experience in the Fordist metropoles of the USA  and the anthropology of ethnic marginality in East Asia  this article constructs a relational concept of the ghetto as a Janus  faced instrument of enclosure and etho racial control  Through this procedure  the ghetto reveals itself to be a socio organizational device that is made up of four elements  stigma  boundaries  spatial confinement and institutional encapsulation  that use space to reconcile its two contradictory goals  economic exploitation and social ostracism  The ghetto is not a  natural area  produced by the  history of migration   as Louis Wirth argued  but a special form of collective violence concretized in urban space  The articulation of the concept of the ghetto makes it possible to reveal the relationships between  ghettoization  urban poverty and segregation  as well as clarifying the structural and functional differences between ghettos and ethnic agglomerations  This way of proceeding also makes it possible to highlight th role of the ghetto as matrix and symbolic incubator for the production of a tainted identity  indicating that its study can be carried out through analogy to other institutions oriented toward the forced confinement of dispossessed and dishonored groups such as refugee camps and prisons
