This article is an ethnography of thinking and practice about death  the process of dying and personhood among the Cashinahua  Huni Kuin  of Western Amazonia  Brazil and Eastern Peru  It relates gender symbolism  arising from the practice of daily life  to the form that social relations between the moribund person and terrestrial  aquatic and celestial spirits take during each stage of dying  This ethnography is provided as a critical counterpoint to the model of such relations and the processes that surround them known in Americanist studies as  the symbolic economy of predation  in which  exchange  functions as the key process and metaphor  The paper suggests that any analysis of death among the Cashinahua must place emphasis on the whole cycle of consumptive production  not just on the symbolism of predation and exchange
