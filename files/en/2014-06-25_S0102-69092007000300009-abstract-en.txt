Since the seminal writings of Max Weber  the sociology of religion has pictured the Hebraic prophecy as the very matrix of the occidental rationalism  while attributing to it the promise of a future in which Israel would prevail over all other nations  After the experience of the Babylonic exile  such promise has transformed the Jews in a  pariah peoples  self segregated  ritualistic  legalist  oriented by some dual ethics and  as a result  unable to confer a universalistic dynamics to the ethical monotheism peculiar to its own sacred Book  The Hebraic prophecy would have  in this perspective  begun the evolutive process that only the New Covenant  with its universal salvation doctrine via the sacrifice of The Redeemer  would have been able to carry out  It is argued that such reasoning  found in the basis of all the effort of Weber to explain the evolution of the occidental ethics  has developed within some theological framing  It can be seen more precisely in the markings of the  Christian theology of overcoming  which postulates that the New Covenant has superseded Judaism by making universal the access to the divine grace the latter had restricted to a pretense  chosen peoples
