This study analyzes the decisions of members of the House on whether to seek higher office  governor or senator  during the period 1954 1974  It differs from previous ambition analyses in that it offers a more concrete theoretical base for the study of progressive ambition and it attempts to predict which members will seek higher office rather than just analyze the careers of members who did run  Hypotheses are offered which deal with the probability of winning a higher office  the value of the higher office  the value of the present office  and the impact of whether or not members are  risk takers  These hypotheses are then tested  Finally  a number of other hypotheses which follow from the theory are discussed
