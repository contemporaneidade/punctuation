This paper discusses the main features of the Free Trade Area of the Americas  FTAA  currently being negotiated by 34 countries of the Western Hemisphere  It argues that the FTAA would have wide ranging implications for the countries involved  given that negotiations go way beyond merchandise trade liberalization to include several other strategically important areas  such as investment  services  government procurement and the protection of intellectual property rights  Negotiations have been unbalanced in several major respects  The United States excludes from the coverage of the agreement issues that are of fundamental importance for Brazil and other participating countries  including antidumping legislation and agricultural subsidies  On the other hand  the US government and Congress have repeatedly indicated that they are reluctant  even under free trade agreements  to allow additional market access in less competitive  so called import sensitive sectors of the US economy  Even if negotiations were more evenly balanced  it would not be in Brazil s interest to participate in free trade areas with developed economies   much less one such as the FTAA which would encompass such a wide range of issues  Developed countries like the United States have structural advantages over a developing country like Brazil that cannot be eliminated in the coming decades  With the implementation of the FTAA  Brazilian firms would find themselves exposed to free competition with larger and more powerful North American corporations  Moreover  participating countries would have to give up many instruments of government policy and national development programs would move out of their reach
