This paper seeks to explain why exchange rate crises of rather similar causes and magnitude can be so much harder for one emerging market country to absorb and bounce back from than for another  Our argument takes three recent currency crises as examples  Argentina  late 2001  and Brazil  early 1999 and mid 2002  We conclude that most of the difference resulted from the structure of domestic political institutions and the incentives for cooperation and conflict that such institutions created for political incumbents and other players
