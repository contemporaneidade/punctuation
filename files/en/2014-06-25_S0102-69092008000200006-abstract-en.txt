Over the last 15 or 20 years  some sort of elective affinity has been established between feminist epistemology and various kinds of post modern constructivism  This has been done to the extent that both postures question the possibility of a neutral and universal knowledge relative to subjects that are conceived in terms of totalizing  homogeneous  and closed identities  However  in spelling out the dangers of essentialism and overgeneralizing  many concepts and categories which are central to the feminist theory have been questioned  generating an increasing skepticism about the possibility of emancipatory knowledge  My aim in this paper is to demonstrate that critical realism s replacement of epistemological questions for ontological ones and its method of contrastive explanations may contribute to the construction of a type of knowledge that is both critical and emancipatory  Simultaneously  this is a type of knowledge that avoids practices such as a priori universalization  overgeneralizing  and essentialism
