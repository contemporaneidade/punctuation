The regulatory reform of the decade of the 1990s provided evidence of deep transformations in Brazilian institutions  With the creation of regulatory agencies  new regulating governance was established in the country  delegating powers for the regulation of sectors fundamental for citizens to autonomous entities  With the inclusion of new actors within the regulatory environment   national and international firms  new users  investors  etc   mechanisms for maintaining transparency and accountability became necessary  Based on these transformations  I examine the role played by the Federal Court of Auditors   Tribunal de Contas da Uni o  TCU  as an institution for horizontal accountability in controlling regulatory agencies  I analyze Auditors Court rulings  employing both documentary research and qualitative interviews with institutional actors who are involved in the field I am looking at  I argue that the way in which the Court of Auditors  TCU  performs serves to increase the legitimacy of autonomous agencies  to the extent that the decision making process becomes more transparent and democratic  From the user s point of view  I conclude that the power of sanction of the Auditor s Court has contributed to a more balanced relationship between users and authorities  while taking increased citizens  demands within the regulatory arena into account  This article is divided into four sections  In the first section  I discuss the position of the Federal Auditors Court within current Brazilian regulatory arrangements and present my working hypotheses  In the following section  I engage in discussion of the major arguments within the literature on the delegation of powers and horizontal accountability  In the third section  I present my research design as well as the methods used in this study  Finally  in the fourth section  I analyze the discourse of three selected rulings  in order to test the hypotheses presented in the first section
