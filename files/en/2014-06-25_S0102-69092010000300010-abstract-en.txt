This paper problematizes the conception of agribusiness  in vogue amidst Brazilian ruralists  dealing with the understanding of the social relations subjacent to this universe  By questioning the essentially productivist approach applied to register the changes undertaken in areas regarded as  modern  or even as  new agricultural frontier  of the country  we seek to more fully understand the relationships established between those who administer the agricultural and industrial production and their subordinates  mapping out the web of social relations across the sector  However  our concern has been broader than the agricultural unit or the industrial plant  we aim at identifying studying the setting of social positions and opposition that have allowed the very existence of the so called agribusiness  Additionally  we have also been interested in observing how these positions have been consolidated  or been opposed  towards a set of public policies  sectoral or not  that have marked and continue to define the shaping of state intervention in these areas  even though such policy mechanisms have been differently perceived by distinct social groups and implemented from not necessarily synergistic government strategies
