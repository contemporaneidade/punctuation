In this paper  we wish to show how  in the past decades  the relationship between science and ethics became central in scientific practice  Recent questions challenge the commitment of scientific knowledge with an objective view of things and the promotion of happiness  To reflect on such issues  we borrowed the concept of practice  as outlined by the Scottish moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre  so as to understand the relation between the questions properly pertaining to scientific knowledge and those linked with the utility of science  By way of conclusion  we think it relevant to stress a current task of scientists  not only that of defending the classic values intrinsic to science  defining its own practice  but also that of considering the vital place occupied by science in our society  thus calling attention to its extrinsic values  which in fact are part of its modus operandi
