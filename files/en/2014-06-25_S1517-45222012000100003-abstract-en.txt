School reproduces social inequalities everywhere as it is more favorable to already advantaged pupils  This is  however  a too general  law  for explaining the large variations revealed by international comparisons in the amplitude of this reproduction  Relying upon these studies  this paper shows first that these variations cannot be explained directly by the amplitude of social inequalities  In order to explain them  two other factors must be raised  The first one concerns the organization of the school systems  which may either widen or mitigate the impact of pupils  social background on their academic achievement  The second one concerns the influence of diplomas on access to various social positions  The paper shows that the more diplomas play a deciding role  the more pronounced are school inequalities and the more acute is the reproduction of social inequalities  Finally  it is not only what is produced in school and through its operation that determines the amplitude of the reproduction  but the own role attributed to school by the various societies  This study achieved on a sample of countries stands at an aggregate level  and some qualitative complementary studies would be very useful for better understand how social reproduction operates
