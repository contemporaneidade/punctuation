The aim of this paper is to investigate different ways of understanding the relationship that civil society actors establish with the mass media  in order to shape public policies and to communicate with broad audiences  Therefore  we explore two models   one derived from the theories of resources mobilization and political mobilization  and the other derived from the theories of collective identity and recognition  We examine the premises and some theoretical contributions and weaknesses of these models to approach the influence that collective civic actors may exert on the political and civic spheres  through mass media communication  The objective is not to argue that one model should overcome the other  but rather to point out that an integrated model allows for the articulation between the informal arenas of civil society and the formal domains of the political system  It also helps one to distinguish among different forms of communication   such as aesthetic expression  bargain and argumentation  which present different logics  effects and criteria of success
