This paper contributes to the debate on the occurrence of a process of internationalization of the Science  Technology and Innovation Policy   STIP  a process in which different countries adopt the same views of the STIP  the same instruments and similar forms of management of the STIP  The debate shows that the dissemination of these ideas occurs through the international relations in the STIP  i e  contacts at the international level  mediated by international organizations and multilateral agencies  in addition to the authors  knowledge of the works of others  The central argument developed here is that the historical evolution of the STIP is strongly correlated with the evolution of the dominant conception of science  In other words  the focus  the instruments  and the forms of management that define the STIP in a given time are closely related to the dominant conception of science  Insofar as the dominant conception of science tends to be international  the policies of STI raised by this concept are likely to be international too  And it is this relationship between the concept of science and the logic of the STIP that constitutes what has been labeled  in this text  as the paradigms of science and technology policy
