In this text  Timothy Cook analyses political news from a point of view that considers media as a singular social institution  The production of news is understood as a collective process defined by the routines of journalism as an institution and by the choices implied in these routines that are accepted and reproduced in the everyday production of the news  The partial independence of news reporting relative to politics does not hinder  however  that the news function as a political and even governmental institution  Besides publishing political information  defining what is important and interesting  journalists give relevance political actors and certify their authority  The news is the result of conflicting relationships between journalists and sources  where the weight is balanced between official sources and the values inherent to journalistic routines
