This paper rescues the theoretical conceptual debate that involves the theme the informality  in essence  that of dominance relationships that favored the capitalist accumulation in this country  Starting from the data of PNAD 2006  the distribution of the busy workforce is also analyzed  Who are the informal ones and how are they distributed  Which income and education profile do they have  These discoveries corroborate the analytical arguments that understand the informality as a basic structural problem in Brazilian society  Its growth asserts the historical picture of inequality and poverty that marked its development pattern  Even if the economy grows again  there will be a considerable contingent of workers that  unless benefitted with solid educational policies  will never have the possibility of being incorporated in the regulated economy
