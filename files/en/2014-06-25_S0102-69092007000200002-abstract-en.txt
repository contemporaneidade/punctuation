Taking as reference Brazilian women s insertion in the Spanish sex market  in this article I analyze how corporality and gender take part in the contemporary transnational sex industry  First  I consider these women s trajectories  considering the cultural  political and economic implications of this modality of migration  Then  creating a comparative perspective by contemplating the conceptualizations that permeate relationships between foreigners and Brazilian women in the Brazilian sex industry  I consider the meaning of shifting contexts regarding the differentiations that permeate their incorporation in the Spanish sex market  I reflect on this exploring how constructions of gender  nationality  ethnicity   race  class  and age are activated in the commercial interactions of those migrants
