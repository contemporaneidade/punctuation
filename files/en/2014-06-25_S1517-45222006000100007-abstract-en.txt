This article discusses Niklas Luhmann s understanding of complexity  its role in theory  and the different ways for its use  It starts from a paradigmatic change that took place in the field of Science in general after the rupture of the Newtonian model  In the 20th century  the paradigm of order  symmetry  regularity  and regulation of the intellect over things enters a crisis  After new formulation in Physics  Chemistry  etc  a new universe emerges over the bases radically opposed to those of modern Science  There is rehabilitation of chaos  process irreversibility  indeterminism  the observer  and complexity  That new conceptual environment served as the substrate for Niklas Luhmann s theoretical reflection  Through the Theory of the Social systems  the author proposes the reduction of the world s complexity  The role of social systems is to reduce complexity by its difference regarding the surroundings  By reducing complexity  on the other hand  he also builds his own complexity  Luhmann sees complexity when it is no longer possible that each element relates in any moment to all others  Complexity forces selection  which means contingency and risk  Luhmann further discusses the concept of complexity by introducing the figure of the observer and the distinction of complexity as the unity of a multiplicity  He also deals with the limit of relationship connections  the time factor  self reference of the operations  and representation of complexity as meaning  Finally  the article deals with complexity in the system of science  the way it reduced internal and external complexity according to its own operative basis
