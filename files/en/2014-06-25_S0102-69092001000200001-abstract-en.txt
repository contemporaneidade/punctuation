The paper discusses the question of the constitutive relationship between social class and social movement  Instead of accepting a social movement as the result of one social class  it is argued that a social class is also made of collective actions namely social movement  This implies that the social class cannot be treated as an independent variable  claiming an objective status  This is considered to be a form of reifying the notion of class  Against this  it is argued that class is the product of a collective action which can be analyzed regarding its social composition  its organizing social networks and its cultural framing  Such a framework of class analysis is then applied to a middle class approach that has proved to be particularly suitable  Instead of repeating old claims of a non homogeneous middle class  which reduces a class of people to a mass of people  it is shown how this class constitutes itself in a continuous action and mobilization process  as a social class with distinctive boundaries  networks and cultural orientations  In this sense  class matters  and class analysis can still be seen as a central tool for understanding macrosociological phenomena
