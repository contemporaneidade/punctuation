Adopting an ethnographic perspective  in this article I explore the complex interconnections between the circulation and creation of personal relations in the prison environment  focusing in particular on Rio de Janeiro  The argument unfolds on three levels of analysis  an examination of the institutional mechanisms responsible for the circulation of men and women in the penitentiary system  the discussion on the value of freedom and methods of escaping  the appreciation of modes of subjectivization contained in the production of  delinquency  In this way I look to contribute fresh material to the debate on recent changes in the Brazilian penitentiary system  including the growth of prison parks  the hardening of the penal system and the creation of new forms of organization among prisoners
