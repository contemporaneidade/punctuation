The article claims that there is already a close connection between normative and positive projects in political theory  The argument is that  traditionally  normative political theorists have embraced rationality assumptions  both because they were interested in persuading an audience  presumably capable of responding to reasons  and because a normative theory deals with rational subjects  whose actions can be understood and perhaps changed by altering their institutional context  By examining the work of Aristotle  Hobbes and Rousseau the article attempts to do two things  first  to elucidate their conceptions of rationality and show the work rationality does within their theories  Second  the article examines how those conceptions  or interpretations  of rationality depart from current understandings and argues in favor of recovering some lost aspects of rationality as an analytical concept
