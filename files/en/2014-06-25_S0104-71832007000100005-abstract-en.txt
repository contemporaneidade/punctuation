Religion is often claimed to contribute to social capital  though under certain circumstances  it is widely recognized that movements of religious renewal and revival are mostly commonly observed among low income  and marginalized populations  and sometimes seem to be the only institution builders in circumstances of extreme poverty and institutional decay or vacuum  religious movements exhibit numerous undemocratic features  authoritarian hierarchies  strong pressures on followers to make sacrifices  to conform  and to contribute money  This paper explores the theoretical implications and support for these apparently paradoxical observations by adopting a rational choice approach augmented by the concept of power  and a concept of social capital which emphasizes transparency and the building of democratic institutions in society as a whole  The argument is illustrated by examples from Latin American evangelical churches and ultra Orthodox Judaism  and concludes with the view that while the contribution of religious movements to democratization at large is limited  this is not a sufficient reason for belittling what they can do for their own followers
