This work discusses some aspects of the conceptual debate surrounding the notions of peasantry and peasant society and the social transformations affecting the rural world  emphasizing the problem of the relation between peasants and the State  The analysis highlights a significant example of this relation  foreign colonization  resulting in public policies designed to stimulate the occupation of empty lands  which began in the south of Brazil in 1824  The case allows us to observe the role of the State in controlling a process of populating the land with European immigrants and the consequent formation of a type of ethnic peasantry distinct from other Brazilian rural lifeworlds
