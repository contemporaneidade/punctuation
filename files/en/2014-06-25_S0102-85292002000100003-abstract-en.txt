The Planafloro project  funded by the World Bank in Rond nia during the nineties had as its main objective the management of the state s natural resources  The lack of capacity and of political will of implementing agencies eventually led Rondonian civil society organizations to request the investigation of Planafloro by the Inspection Panel  The panel is an accountability mechanism of the global civil society that oversees certain policies and procedures by the World Bank  The strategies that climaxed in the request for investigation of Planafloro unfolded in a context of social and environmental activism orchestrated by a transnational public advocacy network  The dominant assumption in the literature is that the participation of local groups in transnational advocacy networks contributes to a relative increase of their political capacity  The case of Planafloro reveals that local groups  participation in transnational networks  while increasing their political weight  entails new responsibilities and challenges that they are not always ready to shoulder  In the long term  this fragility may compromise political gains
