This article analyzes how federal representatives have exercised their functions in both  legislative  and  political  control in deliberation around international acts  The literature in the field seems to indicate that in Brazil  legal control is faulty  and that within the field of International Relations  much the same could be said  A reconstitution of legislative procedures regarding legislative bills  PDL  has enabled us to identify patterns of interaction of powers  showing that the Executive prevails in deliberations on international agreements  Beyond the fact that the Legislature has only the prerogative of presenting objections to these bills  the Executive must control the time that deliberation on international acts is able to take within permanent commissions and  in most cases  the nomination of relaters  In short  even more than within domestic politics  the precepts of the Federal Constitution and the control mechanisms for the agenda that is available to Executive power place significant restrictions on operating fields in deliberations on international agreements  primarily with regard to  legislative control  The efficacy of control mechanisms of the  political  type  such as requests for information  remain circumscribed by the potential constraints of the electoral order
