Michel Foucault published two autobiographies  one of Pierre Rivi re and the other of Herculine Barbin  In this article  I take his introduction to the collected volume Vies Parall les as a key to explaining how he conceived the two works and what he intended by publishing them  Parallel lives are those whose differences condemn them and set them apart  Nonetheless  in the precise moment in which this movement of separation operates  some of them leave behind traces  their autobiographies  These instantaneous and glowing traces illuminate conflicts that are soon forgotten under the shadows of stigma  but that nonetheless construct our subjected subjectivity
