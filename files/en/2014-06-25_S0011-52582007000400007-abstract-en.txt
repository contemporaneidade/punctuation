This article critically analyzes new sociological approaches to the rational choice theory which   beyond examining political or economic practices   link the notion of instrumental rationality to social issues and themes  The article begins by highlighting the issue of trust  indicating the functionality of certain social arrangements in collective problem solving  The paper goes on to demonstrate that problems emerge with the theory when it attempts to explain the feasibility of social norms in impersonal  comprehensive contexts  Thus  the fundamental point that appears to be missing from rational choice theory is the perception that individual decisions and instrumental conduct itself incorporate dispositions that in a sense are beyond the actors  control
