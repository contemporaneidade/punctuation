The author analyses the electoral participation in the 2002 election in relation to the forms of associativism  The hypothesis is that the voter with more associative links is more willing to have electoral participation  The results suggest that the active voters are more participant in strikes and unions  but this active behavior is not related to party afiliation  The data come from the 2002 Brazilian Electoral Study
