How can we end a deliberation  What is the concrete result that a deliberative forum may address to the institutions and the public  The deliberative theory is not clear on this issue  while the practice tends to switch between different solutions  In principle  the conclusion of a deliberation should meet two criteria  faithfulness and straightforwardness  Since these criteria are contradictory  practical experiences tend to favour one of them  Through the analysis of the most diffused practices  the paper considers four types of conclusions  two of them point mostly on fidelity  the  mirror conclusions  and two on straightforwardness  the  proposal conclusions  The strengths and weaknesses of these four types of conclusion are then evaluated
