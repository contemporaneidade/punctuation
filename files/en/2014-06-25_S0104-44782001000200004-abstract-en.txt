This article focuses on the interaction between the political mobilization and demobilization of society  on the one hand  and the process of change in political institutionality  on the other  My basic hypothesis is that mobilization cycles and cycles of institutional reform interact  feeding into each other  I suggest that there are two distinct mobilization cycles  one of entrance and one of exit from the military regime that was installed in 1964  Each cycle involves corresponding cycles of institutional reform  leading in different directions
