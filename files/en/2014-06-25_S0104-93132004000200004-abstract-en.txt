The current ecological crisis has led to a critical review of anthropology s mainstream paradigms and to questions over its contribution to environmental policy making and the political aims of environmental movements  This article argues that anthropology is valuable in two ways for those attempting to build a more sustainable society  Firstly  it produces critical information and knowledge about the meanings of pre modern and modern human attitudes towards the natural environment  Secondly  and more importantly  by providing methodological guidelines for studying relations between culture and the environment  anthropology allows us to understand these relations as the outcome of mutually contradictory processes of producing meaning  shy  one rooted in the unequal transformation and appropriation of nature  the other opposed to a consumerist vision of culture  At the same time  by apprehending culture as a historical process  anthropology is capable of overcoming the failures of radical cultural relativism which have so far limited the discipline s participation in environmental policy making
