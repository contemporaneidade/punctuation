This essay aims at systematizing the theoretical analysis that Marx makes of pre capitalism and of capitalism as social structures of power  bearing in mind that political relations predominate in the former and economic relations in the latter as forms of domination  In pre capitalism  political power and the monopolized exercise of physical  social and psychological violence are determined by the manner in which social agents appropriate objective  material and symbolic conditions of social production  In capitalism  production  when it is already commanded by capital  on top of producing surplus value  it also produces a system of general exploitation of the natural and human properties with the support of science  In other words  it fulfills the appropriation through science and not violence or personal power  putting scientific knowledge at its service  in the form of fixed capital  This extraction of surplus value takes on the form of scientific activity  in spite of being a result of the economic relationship  It is within this context that the analysis of intellectual labor is made  not only as value producer  but also as producer of concepts to justify the historical forms of power and of capitalist domination
