Two basic themes are discussed and examined in this paper  the incorporation of ten new members into the European Union frame and the creation of institutional legal structure supported by a Constitution  To do so  I propose  on one hand  to reconstitute the political institutional steps which covered the period coming from post war Europe  fragmented and weakened  to a post Cold War Europe ready to spread throughout the continent  This process began in May 2004 with the incorporation of ten States of Eastern Europe  On the other hand  I intend to reproduce the institutional debate between a Federal Europe and a Europe of States  debate which conducted to the presentation to the European Council of the project of the new Treaty of the Union  which met in Salonika  in June 2003  second  to the discussion of the text of the first European Constitution  in the Summit of Heads of States of EU  held in Brussels  December 2003
