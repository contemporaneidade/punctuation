Situated in the field of metatheory  the present paper aims to discuss one of the main premisses underlying contemporary sociology  the idea of historicity  As opposed to the sociological theory produced being the 1940s and 1970s  the new sociologies have sought to overcome the dominant epistemological premise of that period   overdeterminantion by theory  In their effort  they have granted the idea of historicity a central role in the understanding of human action  Action is not a blind process  as an opening to the future  component of liberty  it reveals both its grounding on the social and physical situation and its possibility of transcending that situation
