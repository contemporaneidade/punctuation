If  on the one hand  the  first modernity  built the meaning of the future as a time for experimentation  on the other hand  the  second modernity  sees it as an uncertain dimension  as a potential limit more than a source of resources  This new semantic format also configures  in a profound manner  the ways and forms with which juvenile biographies are defined  While a  life project  constitutes less and less of the principle that can structure biographies in an ever  presentified  period as that of contemporaneity  new modalities of relationship with the future  and with time  are drawn up  These forms of temporalization  particularly visible in the construction of juvenile biographies  however  do not imply the pure and simple loss of a future and the renunciation of the project as such  As recent researches show  it is quite the opposite  at least  a part of the juvenile world appears to be actively involved in the construction of means of mediation between the need for a subjective control over future time and the present highly risky and uncertain social environment
