This article attempts to extract the theoretical implications arising from the fact that anthropology not only studies relations  but that the knowledge it produces in the process is itself a relation  It therefore proposes an image of anthropology as an activity founded on the premise that the procedures characteristic of the discipline are conceptually of the same order as those it investigates  Among these implications is the rejection of the contemporary notion that each culture or society embodies a specific solution to a generic problem  filling a universal form  the anthropological concept  with a particular content  the native conceptions  Much the opposite  the image proposed here suggests that the problems themselves are radically heterogenic  and that the anthropologist cannot know beforehand what these will be
