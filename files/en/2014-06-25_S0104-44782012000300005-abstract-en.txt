Legislative studies has been one of the areas of research that has developed the most in Brazil in recent years  It sprang up around the opposition between  distributionist  and  political party  explanations of the legislative process  The empirical findings and theoretical debate developed therein have certainly brought major contributions to Political Science in the country and  at the same time  to the debate on comparative politics  Nonetheless  this line of research has also been marred by one dimensional approaches to the phenomenon  Political party explanations have promoted the notion of a certain  insularity  of Legislative power in relation to other institutional arenas  leading to its analysis in terms of self determination  The distributionist approach  on the other hand  has invested exclusively in the electoral system as an explanatory variable  thus relegating other institutional arena to a secondary level  In face of this  our proposal is to analyze the limits of current approaches in legislative studies  giving salience to some explanatory lacunae that could be better dealt with through a multidimensional research agenda that  for example  takes political party organizations and the judiciary into account
