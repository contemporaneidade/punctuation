This article follows some of Marcel Mauss s insights to discuss the coexistence of the distinctive logics of gift relations and commodity relations in brazilian society  The analysis is based on field research developed in Curitiba  Paran  Brazil  which focused the conflicts that arise between consumers and suppliers in the market place  The evidence points out that the establishment of some sort of equivalence between the transactors as subjects is as important in commodity relations as it is recognised to be in gift relations  affecting even the claims concerning consumer rights presented to state agencies  In more general terms  the article suggests that pacific transactions and conflicts in the market place might be understood as part of the same communication system  in which the general principle of reciprocity encompasses the instrumental dimension of commodity relations
