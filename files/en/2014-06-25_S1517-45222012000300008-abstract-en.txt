From the second half of the 20th century on  several social and political writers have turned their attention to Alexis de Tocqueville s work  By doing that  these writers re read Tocqueville from the perspective of liberal democracy  The basic assumption was that there was  in his approach  precious clues for the understanding of modern democracy dilemmas  This perception  though  supposes some nexus between the concepts of liberalism and democracy which is far from Tocquevillian intellectual scenery  In this article  I intend to identify the conservative bias inherent to Tocquevillian analysis  In this sense  his work will be interpreted in the light of French liberal tradition  in which it is located  It must be added that this tradition is connected to the two races quarrel  as defined by Henri de Boulainvilliers in the end of 17th century  It deals with the genesis of a triple polarity in Tocqueville s work  in a positive axis  liberty  heterogeneity and decentralization  in a negative one  equality  homogeneity and centralization
