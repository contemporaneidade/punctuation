This article discusses notions of  laws   Justice  and  the Law  in E  P  Thompson s work  Our goal is to achieve an understanding of how such notions have been articulated and how they connect with ideas of  experience  and  culture  The specific works studied are those published in the book intitled The essencial E  P  Thompson  edited in 2002 by historian Dorothy Thompson  Furthermore  we seek an understanding of the possible political consequences that these notions hold  today  for the thought and action of a democratic Left  We conclude that Thompson s defense of the  domain of the Law  as an unquestionable human conquest further suggests a rethinking of the way in which the critique of liberal democratic regimes is usually carried out  since quite often the critique of capitalism is mistakenly understood as a critique of democracy  as if the two were an inseparable unit  Nonetheless  we should not forget that capitalism only became democratic through a long and hard struggle for rights  civil rights  in the 18th Century  political rights  in the 19th Century and social rights  in the 20th Century  Thus  it was the action and the words of  the underdogs  that not only made liberalism progressively democratic but  on many occasions  threw up barriers to the destructive furor of capitalism
