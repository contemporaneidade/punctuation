Over the past quarter century  detailed genus   and species level similarities in cellular morphology between described taxa of Precambrian microfossils have been noted and regarded as biologically and taxonomically significant by numerous workers worldwide  Such similarities are particularly well documented for members of the Oscillatoriaceae and Chroococcaceae  the two most abundant and widespread Precambrian cyanobacterial families For species of two additional families  the Entophysalidaceae and Pleurocapsaceae  species level morphologic similarities are supported by in depth fossil modern comparisons of environment  taphonomy  development  and behavior  Morphologically and probably physiologically as well  such cyanobacterial living fossils have exhibited an extraordinarily slow  hypobradytelic  rate of evolutionary change  evidently a result of the broad ecologic tolerance characteristic of many members of the group  and a striking example of Simpson s  rule of the survival of the relatively unspecialized  In both tempo and mode of evolution  much of the Precambrian history of life   that dominated by microscopic cyanobacteria and related prokaryotes   appears to have differed markedly from the more recent Phanerozoic evolution of megascopic  horotelic  adaptationally specialized eukaryotes
