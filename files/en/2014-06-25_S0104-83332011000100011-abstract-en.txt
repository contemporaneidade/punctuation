The present article is an integral part of a research inspired in the fields of Gender Studies that approximate theorizations by Michel Foucault  1998  1997  We discuss the contemporary educative process as  politicization of femininity and motherhood  a process that  in its extension  includes the  politicization of the pregnant body  In order to conduct this discussion  we have examined issues of Pais   Filhos  a magazine published from 1968 to 2004  using methodological strategies of analysis of discourse  From the analyses resulting from that investigation  we have spotted a movement that allows for the visualization of a wider network of care and new knowledge  defined as  good  prenatal care  that produces different subject positions  one of these positions is that of a good mother  i e  that one who looks after herself and others
