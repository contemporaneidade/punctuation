This article considers a comparative analysis of the sociologies of Bourdieu  Boltanski   Th venot  and Latour   Callon  Following a descending dialectic of the Bourdieu material structures to the ideal heights of Boltanski and Th venot and to the platitudes of Latour and Callon  the author primarily displays Bourdieu s genetic structuralism as a rational and relational thinking  which establishes a priority to the structures  He shows that the objectivist deviation of the theory of the fields and habitus tends to empty the reflexive capacities in which the actors are reduced into simple agents  In a second moment  the author shows that the Boltanski s and Th venot s sociology of criticism allows to rectify or to correct the critical sociology  It introduces the symbolic mediations that are the Cities and conceive the Devices as commutators  which reestablish the link with the macrosociology  Finally  the author criticizes the elimination of the material and ideal structures that configure the action for the sociology of the actors in net  The action fixes itself in the practices that perform the world  associating human beings and the not human  in a never ending fabric that covers the world
