This paper aims to reconcile the role ascribed to education as a major cause of the recent reduction in inequality in Brazil with a class analysis framework  A series of univariate and multivariate inequality decompositions were carried out  including the between group within group decomposition of the GE 0  index and the regression based decomposition suggested by Fields  2003  Our results show that a  whereas the class structure composition was relatively stable between 2002 and 2011  the educational composition changed dramatically  b  inequality between classes accounts for a larger fraction of total inequality than inequality between educational groups  and c  when class and education are analyzed simultaneously  the fraction of total inequality explained by education falls abruptly  while the relative share of class inequality remains constant  Thus  educational improvement was apparently much more important for the reduction in inequality than changes in the other dimensions captured by class structure
