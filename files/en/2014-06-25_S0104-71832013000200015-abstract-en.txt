My main purpose in this paper is to argue on the meaning of the concept of effervescence within durkheimian work  pointing to the role played by this process in the general scenario of his moral theory  Roughly speaking  the argumentation is grounded on the articulation between three structural premises of Durkheimian moral theory  namely  1  the attachment between the sacred and the moral ideal  2  his conception about human nature as essential dual and 3  Durkheim s normative defence of institutionalization of secular morality  Towards the end I incite the reader to think about the pertinence of his defence of a  secular sacred  in the light of the moral challenges in contemporary world
