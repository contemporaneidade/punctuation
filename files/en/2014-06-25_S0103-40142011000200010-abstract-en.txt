This essay aims to analyze the relations between the Catholic Church and the Cuban socialist State over the years after the Revolution  To this end  we established a chronology of these relations that includes the ensuing frictions  conflicts and dialogues   from the expulsion of a bishop and his deportation to Spain after a procession dedicated to Our Virgin of Charity  La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre  Cuba s patron saint  which ended in a march against the Revolution in Havana in 1961  to the visit of pope John Paul II in 1998 and the reconciliation and restructuring of the Catholic Church on the island  As a constant background concern  the chronology takes into account the dilemma between  revolution  and  Catholicism that was introduced in 1959  Thus  the essay traces the long road from initial divergence to the current climate of religious freedom and conciliatory dialogue between Church and State in Cuba
