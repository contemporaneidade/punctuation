The article discusses the process of political and economic transition in Brazil since the close of the Constitutional Congress  Addressing the question from an institutionalist perspective  it is argued that these two dimensions of the transition are not the only ones which should be considered in conjunction  a series of other factors must be taken into account as well  First is the question of the sequential chain within the transition process  policies enacted at a given moment depend upon circumstances generated earlier  both in content and in form  creating a relation of path dependence  Second  this constraint holds greater sway during a transition period  given the fluid conditions under which politics are played out  the political climate and institutions change over time  Third  the actors go through a process of institutional learning  which means the same institutional structures are not operated in the same fashion at different moments  It is necessary to devise a dynamic model for analyzing Brazil s political system during this period  More valuable than any static model would be an analysis of the process which takes into account the intermixing of different political agendas  simultaneously and sequentially  institutional fluidity  and environmental transformations
