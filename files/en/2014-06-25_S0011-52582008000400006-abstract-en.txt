The aim of this study was to test whether political influence comes into play in the approval of loans to State governments by the Brazilian National Senate  Although all the requests for loans submitted to the Senate during the period under study were approved  we demonstrate that the time required for approval depends on the political relationship between the applicant  State Governor  and the Senate members occupying key positions in the review process  Using  survival analysis  technique  we observed that when the State Governor requesting the loan and the Senator reporting on the matter belong to the same party coalition that helped elect the Governor  loans are approved in less time  On the other hand  approval takes longer if the partisan relationship is broken during the loan review process  Finally  we observed that the more loan applications from a single State in the previous six months  the longer the approval time for a new request  This analysis considered all State loan applications reviewed by the Brazilian Senate from 1989 to 2001
