This article looks at recent relations established between Brazil and the People s Republic of China  PRC  Our goal is to draw attention to the results that have been obtained as well as the challenges that remain in Sino Brazilian economic and commercial relations  as they have unfolded over the last two decades  1990 2010  Our hypothesis is that relations between Brazil and China have moved ahead during this period  particularly due to the greater freedom of action promoted by the growing interdependence of the international system  Nonetheless  progress has been limited  largely because of  i  internal instabilities in Brazil and China and  ii  the lack of systematic planning in the Brazil China partnership  In order to verify this hypothesis  we have examined the historical evolution of Sino Brazilian relations  highlighting the first three phases of bilateral relations  which we classify as follows   i  relations management  1949  1974   ii  establishing the fundaments  1974 1990   iii  crisis in bilateral relations  1990 1993  Next  we look at the last two phases of Sino Brazilian relations   iv  the establishment of strategic partnerships  1993 2003  and  v  maturity of Sino Brazilian relations  2003 to the present day  We conclude that  if on the one hand the processes of opening and globalization at the beginning of the 1990s allowed for intensified relations between Brazil and China  on the other hand  Chinese crises of legitimacy at the international level and changes in Brazilian foreign policy created many knots in these relations  While Brazil oscilated between a cooperative  developmentalist foreign policy and a neo liberal one limited to economic interest and submissive to internationally hegemonic forces  China reinforced its pragmatic international behavior  thus widening the logistic profile of its foreign policy and its search for opportunities  beginning in the early 2000s
