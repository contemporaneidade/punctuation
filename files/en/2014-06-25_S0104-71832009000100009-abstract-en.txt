In the last decades  the transnational dimensions of global migrations gained an increasing theoretical and ethnographic importance  By transnational I am thinking about the social ties that permanently link the  sending  and the  receiving  country  One of the consequences of such interpretative shift has been the acknowledgment that such ties and mobilities   real or imagined   are accompanied by the social and symbolic construction of places of belonging  These processes of place making are revealed in the use of remittances and in specific discourses on identity  to mention just a few examples  Based on a case study about Bangladeshis in Lisbon  carried out both in Portugal and in Bangladesh  between 2003 and 2007  I will show that the management of death and dying reveals the ritual dimensions of such processes of place making in transnational contexts
