Since August Compte and Karl Mannheim  but also since Jos  Ortega y Gasset and Antonio Gramsci  the concept of generation has been a relevant topic in social sciences and humanities  As a metaphor for the social construction of time  it has been one of the most influential categories  not only in the theoretical debate but also in the public effects of youth research  Even if the uses and abuses of the concept are rooted in the European context during the period between I and II World War  it has been relevant in the ideological and political debates of other regions  This paper is an attempt to rethink the concept of generation from an historical perspective  pointing out its relevance for contemporary youth debates
