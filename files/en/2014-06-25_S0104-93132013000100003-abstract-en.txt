This present article revisits the theme of how the indigenous people of Amazonia conceptualize humanity  taking as its reference the mythology of the Yanomami  a people who inhabit northern Amazonia  We highlight the apparently contradictory meanings that the concept of humanity may have in native cosmologies  Despite the fact that this problem has not been a matter of much debate  we argue that it is the base for a series of antinomies present in Amazonian ethnology  The most evident of these is the characterization of Amerindian socialities as either  ethnocentric  or marked by an  openness to the Other  We try to demonstrate that the Yanomami conceptualize humanity either as an immanent condition  shared by different species  or as a quality that is exclusive to the kinship community  By establishing a dialogue with Roy Wagner s theory of symbolism  we argue that both of these meanings are dialectically linked and that this articulation is a key aspect of the construction of native sociality
