The changing landscape of international relations after the end of the Cold War has produced new conceptualizations of states perceived as a threat by the United States  the remaining and only superpower  to both its national security and the world order  The most common of these conceptualizations is the term of  rogue state  which was adopted in the official security lexicon of the Clinton administration in the 1990s  With the prospects of  humanitarian intervention  becoming a leading issue in Washington s international agenda  the concept of  failed state  was installed in the political and academic debate  Both terms could be seen as instrumental for the increasing American new interventionism  Yet  a third potential threat to international stability is completely ignored by U S    or any other state   foreign policy makers  the  courtesan state  which  broadly  is one of the results of the process of globalization and the transformation of state power  More precisely  the courtesan state is an analytical concept useful to frame certain states  links with the global illicit economy  This essay argues that the concept is crucial to understand a fundamental aspect of the power struggle that characterizes inter state relations in the post Cold War  and analyzes the courtesan state through its double link with other legitimate state actors  mainly the global superpower  in international politics  and  simultaneously  with non state global actors of the illicit economy
