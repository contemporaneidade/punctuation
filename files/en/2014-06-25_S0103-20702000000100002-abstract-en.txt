This paper is an interpretation of Walter Benjamins Paris  Capital of the 19th Century  Based on the notes Benjamin made on several books he read  mainly during his research at the Bibliot que Nationale  the author discusses the notion of the individual linking it to two themes  First  to the emergence of the fl neur as a translation of the spirit of mobility which starts with modernity  The discussion on the notion of space  especially where it concerns Paris  is essential for this analysis  The fl neur is seen as an uprooted individual who moves around the remodelled urban space  Second  to the proximity between the act of fl nerie and that of intellectual work  Taking fl nerie to be intellectual activity  the author shows how the themes of the distancing and the construction of the object are relevant  both to the detective fl neur and to the reflection in social sciences
