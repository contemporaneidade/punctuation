The article proposes a model to explain why members of Brazil s Lower House transfer substantial legislative power to the president of the republic  Following a brief discussion of the related literature  the main approach to the phenomenon   the personal vote theory   is critiqued  The article contends that this theory is not applicable to the Brazilian case since the transfer of votes within the open list system makes it hard for lawmakers to know who their constituency really is  In a proportional open list system like Brazil s  the only candidates elected are those who garner votes equal to or greater than an electoral quotient obtained by dividing the number of valid votes cast by the seats to be filled  whatever the votes obtained by other candidates on the same list  In other words  it is often the case that a given deputy is only elected thanks to the contribution of votes won by other candidates  The result is that a Brazilian deputy has no information regarding the preferences of his or her true constituency  and the president consequently becomes the intermediary in the lawmaker s relationship with this constituency  The stance these legislators take regarding presidential policies sends out a message to their constituency about their work in the Chamber of Deputies  This likewise accounts for the importance that these lawmakers attribute to the Executive s agenda setting power
