HISTORICALLY science has been pointed out as a male activity  Unfortunatelly  this portrait has changed only after 2nd World War  The present study shows data of female participation within some undergraduate courses at UFRJ  including some which are traditionally carried by males  within the research groups registered in the CNPq database and within the teacher s staff of USP  The study also shows that  although females are increasing within the Brazilian system of science   technology  they seem to have less chances to ascend in career  they are less granted with CNPq fellowship  they are underrepresented within the academic positions at UFRJ and within the members of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences
