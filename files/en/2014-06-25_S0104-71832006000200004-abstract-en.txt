The present paper approaches  through a democratic perspective  the relationship between law and sexuality  Starting with the history of the genesis of this debate in the widest core of the Reproductive and Sexual Rights discourse  it proposes an analysis of the  sexual rights  through the lenses of the fundamental principles and dimensions that concern the exercise of sexuality  Freedom  equality and non discrimination  as well as the protection of human dignity are the keystones that structure the development of a democratic right of sexuality  consistent with pluralistic and lay views required by contemporary democratic societies  Within such conceptual framework the paper considers the protective  defensive and positive dimensions of these fundamental human rights  as well as the main topics and arguments against them  relevant to a broad and structured comprehension of the sexual rights
