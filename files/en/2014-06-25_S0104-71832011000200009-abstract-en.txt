The aim of this article is discussing the importance of consuming and material culture for a determined social strata  In order to carry out research on illegal energy hook ups  a social and technical phenomenon with a strong cultural dimension  I lived for eight months in a lower class neighborhood in Greater Metropolitan Rio de Janeiro  As a resident of the neighborhood  I had insider access to the way of life there and was thus able to study the lifestyle of the so called local elite  who were part of the segment of the Brazilian population increasingly acknowledged by the media as the  new middle class  As a result of increased income  low interest rates and greater access to financing created by the Plano Real  these  new consumers  were now able to purchase durable goods  namely electronics appliances  This new purchasing power often led to elevated status in relation to their peers as well as to changes in behavior  In purchasing more goods  mainly cars and domestic appliances  this group strives to join another social strata  that of the urban middle class
