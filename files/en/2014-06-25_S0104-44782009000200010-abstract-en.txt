Poulantzas claimed that State  Power  Socialism  his last major work  completed the theory of the capitalist type of state that Marx and Engels had left unfinished  1978b  While this immodest but provocative claim certainly merits discussion  it cannot be seriously evaluated in a short essay  Instead I will advance four main arguments  First  Poulantzas developed a major original contribution to the theory of the capitalist type of state that goes well beyond most conventional Marxist analyses and contrasts markedly with studies of the state in capitalist society  Second  he developed a broader approach to the state as a social relation that holds for the capitalist type of state  diverse states in capitalist social formations  and statehood more generally  Third  he adopted both approaches in his own theoretical and historical analyses  And  fourth  his analysis of the current form of the capitalist type of state was highly prescient  with  authoritarian statism  far more evident now than when he noted this emerging trend in the 1970s  After I have advanced all three arguments  I will also note some basic limitations to Poulantzas s approach to materialist state theory  concluding that State  Power  Socialism should be regarded as a modern classic
