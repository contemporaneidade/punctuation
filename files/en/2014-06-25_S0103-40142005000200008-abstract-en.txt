THE AMAZON is entering an era of rapid changes as new transportation corridors traverse the region  stimulating the expansion of logging and agricultural frontiers  The declining cost of transportation has important implications for biodiversity  greenhouse gas emissions  and the long term prosperity of the Amazon society  To analyze this context  we have developed an empirically based  policy sensitive model of deforestation for the Amazon basin  Model output for the worst case scenario shows that  by 2050  projected deforestation trends will eliminate 40  of the current 5 4 million km  of Amazon forests  releasing approximately 32 Pg  10 9  tons  of carbon to the atmosphere  Results from intermediate case scenarios indicate that  although an expanded and enforced network of protected areas could avoid as much as one third of projected forest losses  other conservation measures are still required to maintain the functional integrity of Amazon landscapes and watersheds  Current experiments in forest conservation on private properties  markets for ecosystem services  and agro ecological zoning must be refined and implemented to achieve comprehensive conservation
