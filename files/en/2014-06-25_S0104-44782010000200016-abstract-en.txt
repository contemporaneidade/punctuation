This article examines the newspaper Estado de Minas  coverage of the Minas Gerais Legislature  The following question provides the basis for the text s organization  could the consolidation of a wide project of institutional innovation geared toward democratization and modernization have contributed to the creation of a favorable context for development of a positive public image for the Minas Gerais  State Legislature  ALMG  We argue that several adverse factors blocked the creation  in the 14th Legislature  of such a context  among which we have identified  1  the dual ALMG logic  active and innovative in its institutional model but preserving the traditional vices of Brazilian patterns of parliamentary behavior  2  ALMG institutional development  which insofar as it partook of institutional routine  did not generate newsworthy events  3  the prevalence of negative attitudes on the part of media professionals and a large portion of the Minas public regarding actors and political institutions  seen as an undifferentiated mass  which in turn made it hard to see the Legislature as something different from the sum total of state representatives  4  diminished ALMG presence in political coverage  with the shift which began in the year 2000 in the Estado de Minas editorial line  We conclude that communications media have  at the same time  been perfecting themselves in promoting an information environment favorable to constituency s control over representatives and deteriorating  in the sense of  worse information on the good performance  of political institutions
