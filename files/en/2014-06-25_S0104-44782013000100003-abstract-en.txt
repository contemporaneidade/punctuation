This article argues that the National Council of Justice  CNJ  created in Brazil in 2004  was the result of a political arrangement based on the achievement of the Reform of the Judiciary  In this arrangement the interests of the Federal Supreme Court  STF  prevailed over the others and therefore the result of a constitutional amendment number 45 was a CNJ directed by members of the Brazilian Court  To achieve it we use a review of literature and data analysis  The argument is developed from the logic of approving institutional design CNJ tied to the interests of the STF is the best strategy to be developed by the members of the Court  This can be explained by  1  The judges of the Supreme Court are important political actors  2  The existence of judicial independence guaranteed by institutional prerogatives  3  Political systems with a high degree of fragmentation increases the likelihood of judges  STF  to approve their interests  4  the existence of the mechanism of judicial review extends the degree of influence of the Supreme Courts and 5  Finally  the existence of informal mechanisms of persuasion facilitate the success of the judges of the Supreme Court  From the case study we conclude that  the Brazilian institutional design and the fragmented political system generated a powerful Supreme Court  STF  which is responsible for centralized the judicial policy making  The STF becoming  in this respect  a third chamber of the decision making process
