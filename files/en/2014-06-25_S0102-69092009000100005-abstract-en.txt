The article consists of an ethnographic analysis of the favela consolidation in contemporary Rio de Janeiro  understood here as a result of the juxtaposition of two seemingly contradictory socio historical processes   1  the replacement of favela removal programs by urbanization programs and projects  giving rise to a recent construction boom in the favelas and to an unprecedented commoditization of their space   2  the appropriation of the space of the favelas by the drug trade  which  re produces and reinforces the physical  social  and symbolic boundaries between the favela and the so called  asphalt  This context is explored through a conception of the house as a total social fact  the transition from the stucco shack to the masonry house  increasingly converted into a  fortress  renders the space of the favela and particularly of the house as process  future project  and a source of value  both economic and subjective
