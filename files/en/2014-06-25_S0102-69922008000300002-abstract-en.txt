The core problems of sociological and philosophical theories of knowledge remain insoluble and unrelated since both theories start from static models  The problems can be solved   and the respective theories can be related to each other   without undue difficulties if the acquisition of knowledge occurring within societies is conceptualized as a long term process which  in turn  takes place within societies also considered as long term processes  This approach adds up to being in close agreement with the evidence  The paper points out what needs to be both unlearned and learned in order to pave the way for such a unified theoretical framework to serve as a guide to   and be corrected by   empirical sociological studies of all kinds of knowledge  scientific and practical  as well as non scientific or ideological
