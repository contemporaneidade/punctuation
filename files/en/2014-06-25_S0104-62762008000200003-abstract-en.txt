This article focuses on the political opinions of the Brazilian voters who express partisan feelings  The main goal is to verify if there is a structure in the political opinion of these voters which manifest partisan feelings and if there is variation along time as regards these opinions  The analysis is carried out based on four national surveys applied in different moments  1990  1997  2002 and 2007  The analysis reveals that the opinions of the voters who express feelings for different parties were more differentiated at the beginning of the period established for the present study than at the end of this same period  This seems to be the reflect  in part  of the signals issued by the parties which hold smaller differentiation between each other at the end of the period
