MORE than fifty years since its foundation  the Economic Commission for Latin America  ECLA  continues to be a source of influence and an important research topic on the Brazilian and Latin American economic history  Despite the enduring appeal of the cepalina theory  the scholarly studies on ECLA have done little to examine the reasons why the ECLA s underdevelopment theory was so prominent among policy makers  entrepreneurs and scholars  particularly during the 1950s and 1960s  Likewise  the historiography has rarely attempted to assess ECLA s impact over other economic approaches in Latin America and Brazil in particular  This article aims to advance hypotheses about both issues  that is  the determinants of the cepalina influence during the 1950s and 1960s  and its impact on later economic approaches  The view presented in the article is that the influence exerted by ECLA is a great deal explained by the features of its theoretical and conceptual framework   it was consistent and relevant  on the one hand  and ambiguous and vague  on the other  The article also argues that the cepalina theory was and continues to be influential among economic approaches in Brazil  The article addresses two approaches  the dependency theory and the late capitalism theory  and maintains that both took over some central features which marked the ECLA theory   the emphasis on structures  the minor role of social actors  the stress on a macro perspective and the development of a formal view of history
