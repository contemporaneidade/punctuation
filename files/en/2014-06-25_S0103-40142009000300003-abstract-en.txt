This paper aims to explore the idea that we are currently facing a situation of institutional unrest and political crisis strongly concentrated on political subjectivity  that is  on players  ideas and projects of society  It attempts to discuss the recent crisis in Brazil s Senate as an expression of this situation  but also as a reflection of a wider framework  which affects modern Parliaments in general and could be seen as resultant from a siege laid by government decisionism and social pressures to the Legislative branch  depriving it from its axis and capacity to act  Echoing the dominant features of the present time  political systems and  by inference  Parliaments are rendered less able to interact in a virtuous way with culture and social structures that derive from the new terms of globalized life  that is  with plural  fragmented  reflexive  quick and explosive societies
