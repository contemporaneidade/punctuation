This article emerges from our interest in producing a comparable data base for the metropolitan areas of Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires  Our research reveals the need to identify the technical processes and political skills that  in Brazil and Argentina  give rise to particular modes of producing information on criminality  This  in turn  requires fleshing out the particular conditions that  in each case  turn official criminal data into the object of political disputes  and lead to intra  and inter institutional conflicts   as well as turning it into the stuff of  public opinion  as the debate on public safety moves up on the list of public agenda priorities  This approach enables us to conclude that the figures speak more about the institutions that produce them than about criminality or violent deaths in the Rio de Janeiro or Buenos Aires metropolitan regions per se  Therefore  in this article  we try to show that creating comparable data for metropolitan regions as near and as far Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro demands its part  by  part examination and disaggregation  Only then can data be compared and read as an indicator of violent forms of conflict resolution
