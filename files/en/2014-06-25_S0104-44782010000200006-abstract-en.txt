Taking Nancy Fraser s theoretical trajectory as my point of departure  this text takes recent paths in feminist theory as emblematic in the elaboration of a vigorous theoretical and analytical framework for the development of contemporary feminist theories and theories of justice  Yet the latter have been anchored in the hegemonic considerations of the global North  In this regard  Fraser  as a theoretician from the United States  has developed her thought at a certain distance from the most recent agendas of global feminism  and in particular  from the feminisms of the South  and thus  her reflections show an excessive bias  from a Western perspective  This perception leads me back to the critique of studies done in the Anglo Saxon tradition  particularly through C  T  Mohanty s contributions in this vein  Lastly  I propose the experience of a  fourth wave  in feminist movements and studies in Brazil and Latin America  through feminist circuits of dissemination that operate via horizontal feminist currents   Black  academic  lesbian  male  etc
