The  new genetics   or genomics  has penetrated deeply into a broad range of domains in the contemporary world  spawning a technocultural revolution in terms of gene manipulation that has transformed technologies  institutions  practices  and ideologies  In this paper we analyse the debate over the results of a research project    Retrato Molecular do Brasil  or  A Molecular Portrait of Brazil  that aimed to shed light on the  genetic origins of Brazilians  based on the sequencing of parts of mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome  By focusing on how this survey was received  we will explore some of the new  intense  and abundant forms of relations between  nature genetics  and  culture society  in which DNA appears as an key player in the dispute between modalities for interpreting and transforming social and political realities
