The concept of the economist  rather than being a simple and evident one  is the object of numerous conflicting definitions  The example of the field of French economists  as analysed in a set of interviews and the observation of prospographical data  reveal certain characteristics of these conflicts  These struggles oppose those who detain differentiated forms of capital  which are themselves in correspondence with distinct positions in the field of power  These conflicts put into question both the autonomy and the structure of this scientific field  The relatively weak autonomy of the field of economical sciences is followed by a strong homology between the structure of this field and that of the field of French power in its entirety
