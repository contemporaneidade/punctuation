The aim of this paper is to empirically evaluate the electoral competition in the Brazilian election for Congress  The evaluation focused on the regional dimension of electoral competition  what is sustained by concepts such as informal electoral districts  AMES  2001  2003  or political hamlets  HUNTER AND POWER  2007  ZUCCO  2008  This paper considers electoral results from 1994 to 2010 and uses the imbalance index  TAAGEPERA  1979  in a timing frame perspective as basic criteria because the Effective Number of Parties does not capture the decentralization of electoral competition  Results suggests that the personal and regional political control is not the rule of political competition in Brazil  the informal district theory lacks of empirical support and  the politicians that are successful in avoiding competition do not always get elected and vary in their power over electorate through time
