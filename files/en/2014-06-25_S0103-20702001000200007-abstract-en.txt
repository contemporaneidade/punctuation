In this article  I analyze how the racial question has marked Brazilian politics in the past fifteen years  I start by showing what the idea of racial democracy meant to the process of reconstruction of the Brazilian nationality  and go on to review the studies on the voting behaviour of the Brazilian Black population and discuss the emergence of Black social movements and their incorporation into the political system  I understand that we must see  racial democracy  as a political and social compromise of the Brazilian modern republican state  which was in power from the Vargas  New State until the end of the military dictatorship  This compromise which at present is in crisis  consisted of the incorporation of the Brazilian Black population into the work market  of the expansion of formal education  in other words  of the making of the infra structural conditions of a society of classes that would do away with the stigmas created by slavery  The image of the Black person as one of the people and the banishment from Brazilian social thought of the concept of  race  which was replaced by those of  culture  and  social class  are the main expressions of this compromise
