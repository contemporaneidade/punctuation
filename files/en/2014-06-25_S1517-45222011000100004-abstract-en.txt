In this critical and constructive paper we argue that much received sociology of science is skewed by a presupposed idealist philosophy  one that encourages an uncritical attitude towards the supposed facts of the matter  We propose a critical sociology of science that  1  unfuses science  applied science  and technology    2  emphasizes fallibility in science and the sociology of science   and that  3  deconstructs all claims to authority  Constructively  we sketch the elements of a sociology of science that comprehends the elementary forms of the scientific life as well as contemporary bureaucratized and militarized  normal  science
