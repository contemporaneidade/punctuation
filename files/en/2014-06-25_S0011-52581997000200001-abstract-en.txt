In the academic debate  Brazilian unionism has been characterized both as representative and as non representative   with defenders of both positions grounding their arguments in the same basic facts  Taking issue with these interpretations  the article questions whether or not union membership is a suitable measure of representation  If  given Brazil s corporative union structure  unions do not need to recruit members  to what extent can membership serve as an adequate measurement of union representation  Precisely what do union membership rates measure  and precisely what does it mean to  represent workers  in Brazil  The article first offers a conceptual discussion of the relationship between union membership and representation  The thesis is that in Brazil the former does not suffice as a measurement of the latter  But if the union membership rate is high  what is it measuring in any case  The second part of the text explores the empirical side of the question  through analysis of a 1994 survey conducted within four occupational categories  It becomes clear that membership rates are indicative of the degree to which the union makes its presence felt in the life of those it represents  But it also becomes clear that in and of itself this rate does not account for the complexity of the relations between the rank and file and union leaders  In short  the referent is blurry   but it is there  The text seeks to lend it greater conceptual and empirical clarity
