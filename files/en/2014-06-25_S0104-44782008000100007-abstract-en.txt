Through examination of the political properties and the socio occupational characteristics of S o Paulo state representatives at the 1946 National Constituent Assembly  this article provides evidence of three types  With regard to those who were in control of key positions within the State throughout the period of the Rep blica Velha  1889 1930  there was  i  an important change in the social origin of the elite  ii  at the same time  a greater professionalization of the political class and iii  these two processes were not simultaneous  yet a  political renovation  did occur  identifiable for example through the change in age group within the elite and the marginalization of the old party oligarchies from which leaders were recruited  Data suggest that variation of attributes within the S o Paulo state political class occurred during the Estado Novo period  1937 1945  and   hypothesis to be confirmed   were in fact brought about by the Estado Novo  At a first glance the changing profile of the elite is a result of two successive transformations  first  in conditions of political competition  a fact that has a direct impact on recruitment criteria and second  on selection structure and recruitment mechanisms  thanks to the rearrangements in the bureaucratic apparatuses of the dictatorial State  Yet these institutional variables  the change in regime form in 1937 and the change in the form of the State from 1937 onward  do not fully explain how the bacharel  college graduate  came to substitute both the coronel  rural political boss or member of the rural landowning powers  and the oligarca  oligarch  as the dominant figure in state politics  We conclude that a hypothesis meant to explain the peculiarities of the reformed profile of political elites cannot dispense with an historical analysis within which contextual variables play a decisive role
