The article deals with the meaning of social mobility for black entrepreneurs and businessmen that can be considered as part of a middle class  The metodology consists of the study of life careers and the place of colour therein  In spite of most canonical studies pointing out to the simple fact of social mobility for Black Brazilians as the best piece of evidence of the absence of a colour bar in Brazil  I single out the way in which such bar is perceived by the informants  However  even though most of them have experienced racial discrimination  their response to it varies a lot and none ever lodged a legal complaint  My argument is that individual recognition or perception of racial discrimination do not conflate straightforwardly with an actual and effective political stance in the struggle against racism
