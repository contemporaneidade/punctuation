This article analyzes the process of institutionalization of the House of Representatives in the United States  from its beginnings at the end of the 18th century through the middle of the 20th century  The process is analyzed through three fundamental variables  1  defining its functional limits in related to other organizations  particularly those of a political nature  2  the relative complexity of the institution  in other words  to what extent its functions are internally separated on a regular and explicit basis  3  the universalism and automatism of the procedures adopted for carrying out its diverse internal affairs  Throughout the article  each one of these variables is successively examined from a historical point of view  In the manner of conclusion  several speculative observations on causes  consequences and possible lessons to be learned from these processes of institutionalization are presented
