This paper discusses political transitions in Brazil within the context of globalization  It focuses on the political legacies that offered resistance to external processes and the  new brakes and counterweights  that constituted the relevant conditions for processes of political decision formulating and making during the nineties  I also show that the management of macroeconomic policies  combined with broader political processes  was an important dimension of these transitions  I conclude by emphasizing the challenges that exist in the arena of the treatment of social issues and the connections between domestic and external environments
