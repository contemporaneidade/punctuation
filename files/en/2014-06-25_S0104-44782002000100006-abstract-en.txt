International literature discussing the transformation of countries  territories and firms brought about by economic globalization and the dissemination of new information technologies has presented some hypotheses that maintain the emergence of new economic and territorial configurations known as  global cities  or  city regions  The latter reflect a new dynamic based on networks of actors involved in intense flows of knowledge and technology  as well as increased abilities for institutional learning  In this paper we discuss such hypotheses in light of experiences in the S o Paulo state economy  considering whether processes of  expanded reconcentration  can be accommodated within the concepts of global city and city region  In addition to the mentioned perspectives  we also examine and take support  in theoretical terms  from the propositions of authors affiliated with the regulationist school  Through a critical reading of these currents  we develop the notion that  precisely due to changes occurring in the economy of the state of S o Paulo during the nineties  there was a spatial concentration of industry which  although demonstrating some aspects associated with the economic spatial configurations known as city regions  has noticeable and significant differences  For this reason  this movement of  expanded reconcentration  marked by the heavy predominance of the Greater S o Paulo  including therein the region known as the ABC  and surrounding regions  Campinas  S o Jos  dos Campos  Santos e Sorocaba  cannot be characterized as a regional dynamic connected with networks of global cities and disconnected from the rest of the Brazilian economy  Furthermore  unlike the international literature that discusses the emergence of global cities  we cannot associate the mentioned changes with a virtual substitution of the secondary sector by the service sector
