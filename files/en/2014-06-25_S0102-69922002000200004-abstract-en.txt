Historically  the contingency is thought by Aristotle  for the first time  in his text peri hermeneias where the philosopher introduces the concept endech menon  translated later as contingency  The discovery of the contingency reflects a new spirit in the works of Weber  Parsons and Luhmann as in the Western philosophy in Husserl  Heidegger  Camus  Sartre and other  that notice the dramatic tension of the relationships and contingent phenomena  In spite of the long tradition of the conscience of the contingency in the western thought  it is the coming of the  postmodernity  relatively late  that brings its meaning to the light of day  Authors as Lyotard  Maffesoli and Bauman explore the discovery of the contingency in the field of the social theory and they show that the world is necessarily as it is but  also  it could be different  Our hypothesis is that the highly contingent character of the modern technique  as long as it penetrates the contemporary society more and more it affects decisively the man and its way of living in the world  in this way the problem of the contingency wins sociological relevance
