The present work develops indicators of regional integration in order to conduct a multidimensional analysis of Mercosur in the period of 1991 to 2006  One premise is that Mercosur cannot be considered a sui generis case but an example of regional integration organization such as the European Union or the Andean Community of Nations  In that sense  although the indicators are developed to be applied in Mercosur  they could be applied in other organizations of regional integration
