The liberalization of the economy and State reforms of the nineties initially seemed to have left industrial nationalism   the framework adopted by post war Brazilian political economy   to the annals of history  However  this perspective has undergone a certain rebirth since the beginning of the nineties  This paper seeks an understanding of this rebirth of technological and industrial neo nationalism within highly autonomous regulatory agencies whose principal mission is the defense of competition and the consumer  My conclusions suggest that the conditions for this reemergence are linked to the way in which these agencies have maintained the technical elites from governmental institutions who were at the forefront of the developmentalist project  in conjunction with the increased regionalization of demands that has been the result of pressures for a new federative pact deriving from conditions of crisis
