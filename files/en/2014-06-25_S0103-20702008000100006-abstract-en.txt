This paper examines the spatial distribution of teachers across the primary school system as a trait of educational policies in Latin America  These policies are generally justified in terms of their impact on the development of equality of opportunities and their emphasis on justice  efficiency and equity  We discuss this question using data from a survey undertaken in Brazil  Argentina  Chile and Mexico  in 96 schools located in poor districts of Belo Horizonte  Buenos Aires  Santiago and Guanajuato  we interviewed 96 teachers and principals  tested 2 048 fourth grade students and surveyed their parents  Recent economic and sociological studies have shown that some of the professional characteristics of teachers  especially their experience  can improve the achievements of poor students  But our data suggest that the distribution of teachers across the school system tends to reduce the equality of educational opportunities for these students by denying them the more experienced teachers
