The article presents a response to the text  Critical theory and deliberative democracy  by Ricardo Mendon a Fabrino  Opini o P blica  vol  19  n  1  Instead of analyzing the fidelity of current democratic deliberative theories to the legacy of the Frankfurt School  it seeks to understand how much they retain from their original emancipatory impulse  The assessment is that the deliberative theory is tied to a trade off between an abstract normativeness  incapable of effective intervention in reality  and the accommodation with the institutions and practices of really existing liberal democracies
