This essay explores the importance of Kardec s Spiritism in Fernando Ortiz s beginnings and in his long  often roundabout  inquiry leading to the notion of  transculturation  In his formative years Ortiz was deeply influenced by Lombroso but also  like so many other writers and intellectuals  by Kardec  He published fundamental essays on Spiritism  especially on the implications of reincarnation for spiritual and social hierarchies  Kardec s doctrine of the spiritual progress of the soul allowed Ortiz to argue for a more inclusionary national project  Kardecism also provided metaphors that run like a thread through Ortiz s major works on African cultures in Cuba and in his poetics  The  transmigration  of the souls  with its possibilities of endless new beginnnings  enabled Ortiz to introduce a spiritual and political element into the far ranging idea of transculturation
