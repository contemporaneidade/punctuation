This article discusses the relations between institutions  interests and ideas  taking as its reference point experiences in social concertation in Europe and welfare system reforms in Latin America in the 1990s  Recognizing that the current debate over these reforms has incorporated the importance of the cognitive dimension of political processes as a way of building more complex and adequate approaches to the phenomena in question  we take a different approach to previous analyses  arguing that the emphasis given up to now to the role of ideas is insufficient to explain either the nature and diffusion of the processes of economic and social reforms  or their legitimacy and political support  The process of adopting ideas has to produce results that are positively assessed and offer answers   whether consensual or not   to questions deemed central to the public agenda  In addition  there is also a complex process of policy learning and mimicking that allows for better understanding of complex developments  expressing the fact that these elements cannot be left out of the explanations  since they may add new dimensions to studies of economic and social reforms inspired by the role of institutions or by political competition
