The paper explores the relationship between what we take to be objective or paramount reality and  roughly  its subjectification  a shadowy world  edging on the imaginative  which I call the scene  I suggest that the two  realities  are mutually implicated  I argue that insofar as we respond to  as we create  these scenes that color our experiences of objective reality  they demand anthropological consideration  I stress the intersubjective nature of subjectivity itself and offer a preliminary attempt at understanding the complex interlocutory dramas  occurring in ritual  for example  or psychoanalysis  that constitute the scene
