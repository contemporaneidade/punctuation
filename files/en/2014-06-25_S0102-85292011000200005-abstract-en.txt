The present article analyzes international organized crime as an international security problem  Its main purpose is to comprehend the rationale and the consequences of the interaction between political authority and organized crime  analyzing the implications of organized crime for sovereignty as well as domestic and international measures to control such organizations  The central argument is that the capacities developed by criminal organizations are functional to their main goal of illicit enrichment  and their development is not an alien or pathological feature  but a constituent part of the social structure  Since organized crime has negative implications regarding the public sector s ability to provide security and welfare to society  governmental control measures such as policing  intelligence and lawmaking are discussed  At the international level  there is ongoing multilateral and bilateral cooperation on the subject  but this agenda does not create an environment of unrestricted cooperation due to divergent internal interests and conceptions  as well as asymmetry in the distribution of costs and benefits of collective action
