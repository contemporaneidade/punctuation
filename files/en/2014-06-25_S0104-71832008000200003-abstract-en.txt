This paper aims at investigating how being gifted  as a category for classifying football players  interacts with the sociocultural construction of the sporting phenomenon  The category and its meanings were analyzed in relation to magic and faith  since the Brazilian football environment is very superstitious  Football players and fans and also the press usually attribute success and failure in the sport to being gifted  The symbolic efficacy of the natural ability is validated as it is accepted and conveyed by its own creators and consumers as a magical fact  That sense causes them to signify the rich Brazilian context of learning how to play football as a matter of luck  players are either gifted or non gifted
