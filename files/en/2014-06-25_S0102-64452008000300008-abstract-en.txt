The article aims at some logical historical conditions of  left wing  totalitarianism  or  equalitarist totalitarianism  The first part intends to show that there is a blind spot in marxism   the twentieth century hegemonic theory on the left   about democracy  and how that same blind spot gave favorable conditions to the rise of totalitarianism and its ideology  The second part traces a genesis of equalitarist totalitarianism  The outstanding reference is bolshevism as pretotalitarian ideology and practice  From that point  the article makes a double logical move  a regressive one  showing how  below marxism  bolshevism rescues the jacobinist politics and how it is going to fuse the jacobinist legacy with the previous traditions blended in marxism itself  and a progressive one  analysing the passage from bolshevik neojacobinism to the ideology and practice of stalinist neodespotism
